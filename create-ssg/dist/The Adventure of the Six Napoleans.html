             <p>THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS</p><br/><p></p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,</p><br/><p>to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to</p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all</p><br/><p>that was going on at the police headquarters. In return for the</p><br/><p>news which Lestrade would bring, Holmes was always ready to</p><br/><p>listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the</p><br/><p>detective was engaged, and was able occasionally, without any</p><br/><p>active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn from</p><br/><p>his own vast knowledge and experience.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>On this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather</p><br/><p>and the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing</p><br/><p>thoughtfully at his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Anything remarkable on hand?” he asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, no, Mr. Holmes—nothing very particular.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then tell me about it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Lestrade laughed.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there _is_</p><br/><p>something on my mind. And yet it is such an absurd business, that</p><br/><p>I hesitated to bother you about it. On the other hand, although</p><br/><p>it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that you have</p><br/><p>a taste for all that is out of the common. But, in my opinion, it</p><br/><p>comes more in Dr. Watson’s line than ours.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Disease?” said I.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness, too. You wouldn’t think</p><br/><p>there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred</p><br/><p>of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of him that</p><br/><p>he could see.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes sank back in his chair.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That’s no business of mine,” said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Exactly. That’s what I said. But then, when the man commits</p><br/><p>burglary in order to break images which are not his own, that</p><br/><p>brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes sat up again.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory</p><br/><p>from its pages.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The first case reported was four days ago,” said he. “It was at</p><br/><p>the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of</p><br/><p>pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had</p><br/><p>left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and</p><br/><p>hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood with</p><br/><p>several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered into</p><br/><p>fragments. He rushed out into the road, but, although several</p><br/><p>passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the</p><br/><p>shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of</p><br/><p>identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those senseless</p><br/><p>acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was</p><br/><p>reported to the constable on the beat as such. The plaster cast</p><br/><p>was not worth more than a few shillings, and the whole affair</p><br/><p>appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The second case, however, was more serious, and also more</p><br/><p>singular. It occurred only last night.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse</p><br/><p>Hudson’s shop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner,</p><br/><p>named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the</p><br/><p>south side of the Thames. His residence and principal</p><br/><p>consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch</p><br/><p>surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles away.</p><br/><p>This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his</p><br/><p>house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French</p><br/><p>Emperor. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two</p><br/><p>duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the</p><br/><p>French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in</p><br/><p>the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece of</p><br/><p>the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came down</p><br/><p>this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been</p><br/><p>burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save</p><br/><p>the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and had</p><br/><p>been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its</p><br/><p>splintered fragments were discovered.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes rubbed his hands.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“This is certainly very novel,” said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end</p><br/><p>yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o’clock, and</p><br/><p>you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he found</p><br/><p>that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken</p><br/><p>pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. It had</p><br/><p>been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case were there</p><br/><p>any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or</p><br/><p>lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes, you have got</p><br/><p>the facts.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“They are singular, not to say grotesque,” said Holmes. “May I</p><br/><p>ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot’s rooms were</p><br/><p>the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in Morse</p><br/><p>Hudson’s shop?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“They were taken from the same mould.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks</p><br/><p>them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon. Considering</p><br/><p>how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor must exist in</p><br/><p>London, it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a</p><br/><p>promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three</p><br/><p>specimens of the same bust.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, I thought as you do,” said Lestrade. “On the other hand,</p><br/><p>this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of</p><br/><p>London, and these three were the only ones which had been in his</p><br/><p>shop for years. So, although, as you say, there are many hundreds</p><br/><p>of statues in London, it is very probable that these three were</p><br/><p>the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local fanatic would</p><br/><p>begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,” I</p><br/><p>answered. “There is the condition which the modern French</p><br/><p>psychologists have called the _idée fixe_, which may be trifling</p><br/><p>in character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other</p><br/><p>way. A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had</p><br/><p>possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great</p><br/><p>war, might conceivably form such an _idée fixe_ and under its</p><br/><p>influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That won’t do, my dear Watson,” said Holmes, shaking his head,</p><br/><p>“for no amount of _idée fixe_ would enable your interesting</p><br/><p>monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, how do _you_ explain it?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I don’t attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a</p><br/><p>certain method in the gentleman’s eccentric proceedings. For</p><br/><p>example, in Dr. Barnicot’s hall, where a sound might arouse the</p><br/><p>family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas</p><br/><p>in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was</p><br/><p>smashed where it stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and</p><br/><p>yet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my</p><br/><p>most classic cases have had the least promising commencement. You</p><br/><p>will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty</p><br/><p>family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the</p><br/><p>parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can’t afford,</p><br/><p>therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I</p><br/><p>shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any</p><br/><p>fresh development of so singular a chain of events.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker</p><br/><p>and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. I</p><br/><p>was still dressing in my bedroom next morning, when there was a</p><br/><p>tap at the door and Holmes entered, a telegram in his hand. He</p><br/><p>read it aloud:</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Come instantly, 131, Pitt Street, Kensington.—LESTRADE.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What is it, then?” I asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Don’t know—may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel of</p><br/><p>the story of the statues. In that case our friend the</p><br/><p>image-breaker has begun operations in another quarter of London.</p><br/><p>There’s coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the</p><br/><p>door.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little</p><br/><p>backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of London</p><br/><p>life. No. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable,</p><br/><p>and most unromantic dwellings. As we drove up, we found the</p><br/><p>railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. Holmes</p><br/><p>whistled.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“By George! It’s attempted murder at the least. Nothing less will</p><br/><p>hold the London message-boy. There’s a deed of violence indicated</p><br/><p>in that fellow’s round shoulders and outstretched neck. What’s</p><br/><p>this, Watson? The top steps swilled down and the other ones dry.</p><br/><p>Footsteps enough, anyhow! Well, well, there’s Lestrade at the</p><br/><p>front window, and we shall soon know all about it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The official received us with a very grave face and showed us</p><br/><p>into a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated</p><br/><p>elderly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and</p><br/><p>down. He was introduced to us as the owner of the house—Mr.</p><br/><p>Horace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It’s the Napoleon bust business again,” said Lestrade. “You</p><br/><p>seemed interested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps</p><br/><p>you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a</p><br/><p>very much graver turn.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What has it turned to, then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly</p><br/><p>what has occurred?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most</p><br/><p>melancholy face.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It’s an extraordinary thing,” said he, “that all my life I have</p><br/><p>been collecting other people’s news, and now that a real piece of</p><br/><p>news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that I</p><br/><p>can’t put two words together. If I had come in here as a</p><br/><p>journalist, I should have interviewed myself and had two columns</p><br/><p>in every evening paper. As it is, I am giving away valuable copy</p><br/><p>by telling my story over and over to a string of different</p><br/><p>people, and I can make no use of it myself. However, I’ve heard</p><br/><p>your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if you’ll only explain this</p><br/><p>queer business, I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the</p><br/><p>story.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes sat down and listened.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I</p><br/><p>bought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up</p><br/><p>cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street</p><br/><p>Station. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night,</p><br/><p>and I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I</p><br/><p>was sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the</p><br/><p>house, about three o’clock, when I was convinced that I heard</p><br/><p>some sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated,</p><br/><p>and I concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about</p><br/><p>five minutes later, there came a most horrible yell—the most</p><br/><p>dreadful sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my</p><br/><p>ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or</p><br/><p>two. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I entered</p><br/><p>this room I found the window wide open, and I at once observed</p><br/><p>that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any burglar</p><br/><p>should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it was only</p><br/><p>a plaster cast and of no real value whatever.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open</p><br/><p>window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride.</p><br/><p>This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went round and</p><br/><p>opened the door. Stepping out into the dark, I nearly fell over a</p><br/><p>dead man, who was lying there. I ran back for a light and there</p><br/><p>was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the whole</p><br/><p>place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees drawn up,</p><br/><p>and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my dreams. I had</p><br/><p>just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must have</p><br/><p>fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman</p><br/><p>standing over me in the hall.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, who was the murdered man?” asked Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There’s nothing to show who he was,” said Lestrade. “You shall</p><br/><p>see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up</p><br/><p>to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than</p><br/><p>thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a</p><br/><p>labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood</p><br/><p>beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or</p><br/><p>whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There was no</p><br/><p>name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple,</p><br/><p>some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here it</p><br/><p>is.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It</p><br/><p>represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man, with thick</p><br/><p>eyebrows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the</p><br/><p>face, like the muzzle of a baboon.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And what became of the bust?” asked Holmes, after a careful</p><br/><p>study of this picture.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in the</p><br/><p>front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It was</p><br/><p>broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will you</p><br/><p>come?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Certainly. I must just take one look round.” He examined the</p><br/><p>carpet and the window. “The fellow had either very long legs or</p><br/><p>was a most active man,” said he. “With an area beneath, it was no</p><br/><p>mean feat to reach that window ledge and open that window.</p><br/><p>Getting back was comparatively simple. Are you coming with us to</p><br/><p>see the remains of your bust, Mr. Harker?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a</p><br/><p>writing-table.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I must try and make something of it,” said he, “though I have no</p><br/><p>doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out</p><br/><p>already with full details. It’s like my luck! You remember when</p><br/><p>the stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in</p><br/><p>the stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it,</p><br/><p>for I was too shaken to write it. And now I’ll be too late with a</p><br/><p>murder done on my own doorstep.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>As we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the</p><br/><p>foolscap.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only</p><br/><p>a few hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested upon</p><br/><p>this presentment of the great emperor, which seemed to raise such</p><br/><p>frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. It lay</p><br/><p>scattered, in splintered shards, upon the grass. Holmes picked up</p><br/><p>several of them and examined them carefully. I was convinced,</p><br/><p>from his intent face and his purposeful manner, that at last he</p><br/><p>was upon a clue.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well?” asked Lestrade.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We have a long way to go yet,” said he. “And yet—and yet—well,</p><br/><p>we have some suggestive facts to act upon. The possession of this</p><br/><p>trifling bust was worth more, in the eyes of this strange</p><br/><p>criminal, than a human life. That is one point. Then there is the</p><br/><p>singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or</p><br/><p>immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole</p><br/><p>object.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He</p><br/><p>hardly knew what he was doing.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, that’s likely enough. But I wish to call your attention</p><br/><p>very particularly to the position of this house, in the garden of</p><br/><p>which the bust was destroyed.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Lestrade looked about him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be</p><br/><p>disturbed in the garden.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street</p><br/><p>which he must have passed before he came to this one. Why did he</p><br/><p>not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he</p><br/><p>carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I give it up,” said Lestrade.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He could see what he was doing here, and he could not there.</p><br/><p>That was his reason.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“By Jove! that’s true,” said the detective. “Now that I come to</p><br/><p>think of it, Dr. Barnicot’s bust was broken not far from his red</p><br/><p>lamp. Well, Mr. Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“To remember it—to docket it. We may come on something later</p><br/><p>which will bear upon it. What steps do you propose to take now,</p><br/><p>Lestrade?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to</p><br/><p>identify the dead man. There should be no difficulty about that.</p><br/><p>When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we</p><br/><p>should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt</p><br/><p>Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on</p><br/><p>the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don’t you think so?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should</p><br/><p>approach the case.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What would you do then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest that</p><br/><p>you go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes</p><br/><p>afterwards, and each will supplement the other.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Very good,” said Lestrade.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“If you are going back to Pitt Street, you might see Mr. Horace</p><br/><p>Harker. Tell him for me that I have quite made up my mind, and</p><br/><p>that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic, with</p><br/><p>Napoleonic delusions, was in his house last night. It will be</p><br/><p>useful for his article.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Lestrade stared.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You don’t seriously believe that?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes smiled.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Don’t I? Well, perhaps I don’t. But I am sure that it will</p><br/><p>interest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central</p><br/><p>Press Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we</p><br/><p>have a long and rather complex day’s work before us. I should be</p><br/><p>glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at</p><br/><p>Baker Street at six o’clock this evening. Until then I should</p><br/><p>like to keep this photograph, found in the dead man’s pocket. It</p><br/><p>is possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance</p><br/><p>upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken to-night,</p><br/><p>if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until then</p><br/><p>good-bye and good luck!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where</p><br/><p>we stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had</p><br/><p>been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding</p><br/><p>would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself a</p><br/><p>newcomer, who could give us no information. Holmes’s face showed</p><br/><p>his disappointment and annoyance.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, well, we can’t expect to have it all our own way, Watson,”</p><br/><p>he said, at last. “We must come back in the afternoon, if Mr.</p><br/><p>Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you have no doubt</p><br/><p>surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in</p><br/><p>order to find if there is not something peculiar which may</p><br/><p>account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for Mr. Morse</p><br/><p>Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can throw any light</p><br/><p>upon the problem.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer’s</p><br/><p>establishment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a</p><br/><p>peppery manner.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,” said he. “What we pay rates</p><br/><p>and taxes for I don’t know, when any ruffian can come in and</p><br/><p>break one’s goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his</p><br/><p>two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot—that’s what I make</p><br/><p>it. No one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues. Red</p><br/><p>republicans—that’s what I call ’em. Who did I get the statues</p><br/><p>from? I don’t see what that has to do with it. Well, if you</p><br/><p>really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in Church</p><br/><p>Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the trade, and</p><br/><p>have been this twenty years. How many had I? Three—two and one</p><br/><p>are three—two of Dr. Barnicot’s, and one smashed in broad</p><br/><p>daylight on my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I</p><br/><p>don’t. Yes, I do, though. Why, it’s Beppo. He was a kind of</p><br/><p>Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. He</p><br/><p>could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and do odd jobs. The</p><br/><p>fellow left me last week, and I’ve heard nothing of him since.</p><br/><p>No, I don’t know where he came from nor where he went to. I had</p><br/><p>nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two days</p><br/><p>before the bust was smashed.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, that’s all we could reasonably expect from Morse Hudson,”</p><br/><p>said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. “We have this Beppo as</p><br/><p>a common factor, both in Kennington and in Kensington, so that is</p><br/><p>worth a ten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder &</p><br/><p>Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of the busts. I shall be</p><br/><p>surprised if we don’t get some help down there.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable</p><br/><p>London, hotel London, theatrical London, literary London,</p><br/><p>commercial London, and, finally, maritime London, till we came to</p><br/><p>a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the tenement</p><br/><p>houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of Europe. Here, in a</p><br/><p>broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy City merchants, we</p><br/><p>found the sculpture works for which we searched. Outside was a</p><br/><p>considerable yard full of monumental masonry. Inside was a large</p><br/><p>room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding. The</p><br/><p>manager, a big blond German, received us civilly and gave a clear</p><br/><p>answer to all Holmes’s questions. A reference to his books showed</p><br/><p>that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of</p><br/><p>Devine’s head of Napoleon, but that the three which had been sent</p><br/><p>to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of</p><br/><p>six, the other three being sent to Harding Brothers, of</p><br/><p>Kensington. There was no reason why those six should be different</p><br/><p>from any of the other casts. He could suggest no possible cause</p><br/><p>why anyone should wish to destroy them—in fact, he laughed at the</p><br/><p>idea. Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the retailer</p><br/><p>would get twelve or more. The cast was taken in two moulds from</p><br/><p>each side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of</p><br/><p>Paris were joined together to make the complete bust. The work</p><br/><p>was usually done by Italians, in the room we were in. When</p><br/><p>finished, the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry,</p><br/><p>and afterwards stored. That was all he could tell us.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon</p><br/><p>the manager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted</p><br/><p>over his blue Teutonic eyes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, the rascal!” he cried. “Yes, indeed, I know him very well.</p><br/><p>This has always been a respectable establishment, and the only</p><br/><p>time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very</p><br/><p>fellow. It was more than a year ago now. He knifed another</p><br/><p>Italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the</p><br/><p>police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo was his</p><br/><p>name—his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engaging a</p><br/><p>man with such a face. But he was a good workman—one of the best.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What did he get?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he is</p><br/><p>out now, but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have a</p><br/><p>cousin of his here, and I daresay he could tell you where he is.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, no,” cried Holmes, “not a word to the cousin—not a word, I</p><br/><p>beg of you. The matter is very important, and the farther I go</p><br/><p>with it, the more important it seems to grow. When you referred</p><br/><p>in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that the</p><br/><p>date was June 3rd of last year. Could you give me the date when</p><br/><p>Beppo was arrested?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,” the manager answered.</p><br/><p>“Yes,” he continued, after some turning over of pages, “he was</p><br/><p>paid last on May 20th.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you,” said Holmes. “I don’t think that I need intrude upon</p><br/><p>your time and patience any more.” With a last word of caution</p><br/><p>that he should say nothing as to our researches, we turned our</p><br/><p>faces westward once more.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a</p><br/><p>hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance</p><br/><p>announced “Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,” and the</p><br/><p>contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got his</p><br/><p>account into print after all. Two columns were occupied with a</p><br/><p>highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident.</p><br/><p>Holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he</p><br/><p>ate. Once or twice he chuckled.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“This is all right, Watson,” said he. “Listen to this:</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of</p><br/><p>opinion upon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the most</p><br/><p>experienced members of the official force, and Mr. Sherlock</p><br/><p>Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have each come to the</p><br/><p>conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents, which have</p><br/><p>ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from lunacy rather than from</p><br/><p>deliberate crime. No explanation save mental aberration can cover</p><br/><p>the facts.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution, if you only</p><br/><p>know how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we will</p><br/><p>hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of Harding</p><br/><p>Brothers has to say on the matter.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp</p><br/><p>little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a</p><br/><p>ready tongue.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening papers.</p><br/><p>Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied him with the</p><br/><p>bust some months ago. We ordered three busts of that sort from</p><br/><p>Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now. To whom? Oh, I</p><br/><p>daresay by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell</p><br/><p>you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr. Harker you see,</p><br/><p>and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale,</p><br/><p>Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of Lower Grove Road, Reading.</p><br/><p>No, I have never seen this face which you show me in the</p><br/><p>photograph. You would hardly forget it, would you, sir, for I’ve</p><br/><p>seldom seen an uglier. Have we any Italians on the staff? Yes,</p><br/><p>sir, we have several among our workpeople and cleaners. I daresay</p><br/><p>they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. There</p><br/><p>is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. Well,</p><br/><p>well, it’s a very strange business, and I hope that you will let</p><br/><p>me know if anything comes of your inquiries.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding’s evidence, and</p><br/><p>I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which</p><br/><p>affairs were taking. He made no remark, however, save that,</p><br/><p>unless we hurried, we should be late for our appointment with</p><br/><p>Lestrade. Sure enough, when we reached Baker Street the detective</p><br/><p>was already there, and we found him pacing up and down in a fever</p><br/><p>of impatience. His look of importance showed that his day’s work</p><br/><p>had not been in vain.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well?” he asked. “What luck, Mr. Holmes?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,” my</p><br/><p>friend explained. “We have seen both the retailers and also the</p><br/><p>wholesale manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts now from</p><br/><p>the beginning.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The busts,” cried Lestrade. “Well, well, you have your own</p><br/><p>methods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a word</p><br/><p>against them, but I think I have done a better day’s work than</p><br/><p>you. I have identified the dead man.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You don’t say so?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And found a cause for the crime.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Splendid!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and</p><br/><p>the Italian Quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem</p><br/><p>round his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he</p><br/><p>was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught</p><br/><p>sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is</p><br/><p>one of the greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with</p><br/><p>the Mafia, which, as you know, is a secret political society,</p><br/><p>enforcing its decrees by murder. Now, you see how the affair</p><br/><p>begins to clear up. The other fellow is probably an Italian also,</p><br/><p>and a member of the Mafia. He has broken the rules in some</p><br/><p>fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Probably the photograph we</p><br/><p>found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not knife</p><br/><p>the wrong person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house,</p><br/><p>he waits outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own</p><br/><p>death-wound. How is that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!” he cried. “But I didn’t quite</p><br/><p>follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After</p><br/><p>all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It</p><br/><p>is the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you</p><br/><p>that I am gathering all the threads into my hands.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And the next stage?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian</p><br/><p>Quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest</p><br/><p>him on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I</p><br/><p>can’t say for certain, because it all depends—well, it all</p><br/><p>depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control.</p><br/><p>But I have great hopes—in fact, the betting is exactly two to</p><br/><p>one—that if you will come with us to-night I shall be able to</p><br/><p>help you to lay him by the heels.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“In the Italian Quarter?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find</p><br/><p>him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade,</p><br/><p>I’ll promise to go to the Italian Quarter with you to-morrow, and</p><br/><p>no harm will be done by the delay. And now I think that a few</p><br/><p>hours’ sleep would do us all good, for I do not propose to leave</p><br/><p>before eleven o’clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back</p><br/><p>before morning. You’ll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are</p><br/><p>welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In the</p><br/><p>meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an</p><br/><p>express messenger, for I have a letter to send and it is</p><br/><p>important that it should go at once.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old</p><br/><p>daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When</p><br/><p>at last he descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but he</p><br/><p>said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches.</p><br/><p>For my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which</p><br/><p>he had traced the various windings of this complex case, and,</p><br/><p>though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I</p><br/><p>understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal</p><br/><p>to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one of which, I</p><br/><p>remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object of our journey</p><br/><p>was to catch him in the very act, and I could not but admire the</p><br/><p>cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the</p><br/><p>evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could</p><br/><p>continue his scheme with impunity. I was not surprised when</p><br/><p>Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with me. He had</p><br/><p>himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop, which was his</p><br/><p>favourite weapon.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a</p><br/><p>spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was</p><br/><p>directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road</p><br/><p>fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds.</p><br/><p>In the light of a street lamp we read “Laburnum Villa” upon the</p><br/><p>gate-post of one of them. The occupants had evidently retired to</p><br/><p>rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door,</p><br/><p>which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path. The</p><br/><p>wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a</p><br/><p>dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was that we</p><br/><p>crouched.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I fear that you’ll have a long wait,” Holmes whispered. “We may</p><br/><p>thank our stars that it is not raining. I don’t think we can even</p><br/><p>venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it’s a two to one</p><br/><p>chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as</p><br/><p>Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and</p><br/><p>singular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn</p><br/><p>us of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark</p><br/><p>figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path.</p><br/><p>We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and</p><br/><p>disappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a long</p><br/><p>pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle</p><br/><p>creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being opened. The</p><br/><p>noise ceased, and again there was a long silence. The fellow was</p><br/><p>making his way into the house. We saw the sudden flash of a dark</p><br/><p>lantern inside the room. What he sought was evidently not there,</p><br/><p>for again we saw the flash through another blind, and then</p><br/><p>through another.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs</p><br/><p>out,” Lestrade whispered.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>But before we could move, the man had emerged again. As he came</p><br/><p>out into the glimmering patch of light, we saw that he carried</p><br/><p>something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round</p><br/><p>him. The silence of the deserted street reassured him. Turning</p><br/><p>his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next instant</p><br/><p>there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter and</p><br/><p>rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was doing that he</p><br/><p>never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. With the</p><br/><p>bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later</p><br/><p>Lestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had</p><br/><p>been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow</p><br/><p>face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at us, and I</p><br/><p>knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had</p><br/><p>secured.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his</p><br/><p>attention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most</p><br/><p>carefully examining that which the man had brought from the</p><br/><p>house. It was a bust of Napoleon, like the one which we had seen</p><br/><p>that morning, and it had been broken into similar fragments.</p><br/><p>Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light, but in no</p><br/><p>way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster. He</p><br/><p>had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up,</p><br/><p>the door opened, and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund</p><br/><p>figure in shirt and trousers, presented himself.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?” said Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the</p><br/><p>note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly</p><br/><p>what you told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited</p><br/><p>developments. Well, I’m very glad to see that you have got the</p><br/><p>rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and have some</p><br/><p>refreshment.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters,</p><br/><p>so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all</p><br/><p>four upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say,</p><br/><p>but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once,</p><br/><p>when my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a</p><br/><p>hungry wolf. We stayed long enough at the police-station to learn</p><br/><p>that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few</p><br/><p>shillings and a long sheath knife, the handle of which bore</p><br/><p>copious traces of recent blood.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That’s all right,” said Lestrade, as we parted. “Hill knows all</p><br/><p>these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You’ll find that my</p><br/><p>theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I’m sure I am</p><br/><p>exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way</p><br/><p>in which you laid hands upon him. I don’t quite understand it all</p><br/><p>yet.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,” said</p><br/><p>Holmes. “Besides, there are one or two details which are not</p><br/><p>finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth</p><br/><p>working out to the very end. If you will come round once more to</p><br/><p>my rooms at six o’clock to-morrow, I think I shall be able to</p><br/><p>show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of</p><br/><p>this business, which presents some features which make it</p><br/><p>absolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you</p><br/><p>to chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee</p><br/><p>that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular</p><br/><p>adventure of the Napoleonic busts.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with much</p><br/><p>information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was</p><br/><p>Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known ne’er-do-well</p><br/><p>among the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and</p><br/><p>had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and</p><br/><p>had twice already been in jail—once for a petty theft, and once,</p><br/><p>as we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He</p><br/><p>could talk English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the</p><br/><p>busts were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions</p><br/><p>upon the subject, but the police had discovered that these same</p><br/><p>busts might very well have been made by his own hands, since he</p><br/><p>was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder</p><br/><p>& Co. To all this information, much of which we already knew,</p><br/><p>Holmes listened with polite attention, but I, who knew him so</p><br/><p>well, could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I</p><br/><p>detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath</p><br/><p>that mask which he was wont to assume. At last he started in his</p><br/><p>chair, and his eyes brightened. There had been a ring at the</p><br/><p>bell. A minute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an</p><br/><p>elderly red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in.</p><br/><p>In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which</p><br/><p>he placed upon the table.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>My friend bowed and smiled. “Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I</p><br/><p>suppose?” said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains were</p><br/><p>awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Exactly.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have your letter here. You said, ‘I desire to possess a copy</p><br/><p>of Devine’s Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for</p><br/><p>the one which is in your possession.’ Is that right?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Certainly.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not</p><br/><p>imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is</p><br/><p>very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had</p><br/><p>sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, he did not.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only</p><br/><p>gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to</p><br/><p>know that before I take ten pounds from you.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have</p><br/><p>named that price, so I intend to stick to it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust</p><br/><p>up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!” He opened his</p><br/><p>bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen</p><br/><p>of that bust which we had already seen more than once in</p><br/><p>fragments.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note</p><br/><p>upon the table.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence</p><br/><p>of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every</p><br/><p>possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a</p><br/><p>methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events</p><br/><p>might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your</p><br/><p>money, and I wish you a very good evening.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes’s movements</p><br/><p>were such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean</p><br/><p>white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he</p><br/><p>placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth.</p><br/><p>Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a</p><br/><p>sharp blow on the top of the head. The figure broke into</p><br/><p>fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains.</p><br/><p>Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one</p><br/><p>splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in</p><br/><p>a pudding.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Gentlemen,” he cried, “let me introduce you to the famous black</p><br/><p>pearl of the Borgias.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a</p><br/><p>spontaneous impulse, we both broke at clapping, as at the</p><br/><p>well-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to</p><br/><p>Holmes’s pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master</p><br/><p>dramatist who receives the homage of his audience. It was at such</p><br/><p>moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine,</p><br/><p>and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. The same</p><br/><p>singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with</p><br/><p>disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its</p><br/><p>depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, gentlemen,” said he, “it is the most famous pearl now</p><br/><p>existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a</p><br/><p>connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the</p><br/><p>Prince of Colonna’s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was</p><br/><p>lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of</p><br/><p>Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You</p><br/><p>will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the</p><br/><p>disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the</p><br/><p>London police to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the</p><br/><p>case, but I was unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell</p><br/><p>upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was</p><br/><p>proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace</p><br/><p>any connection between them. The maid’s name was Lucretia</p><br/><p>Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who</p><br/><p>was murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking</p><br/><p>up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the</p><br/><p>disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest</p><br/><p>of Beppo, for some crime of violence—an event which took place in</p><br/><p>the factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts</p><br/><p>were being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events,</p><br/><p>though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way</p><br/><p>in which they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in</p><br/><p>his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have</p><br/><p>been Pietro’s confederate, he may have been the go-between of</p><br/><p>Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the</p><br/><p>correct solution.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The main fact is that he _had_ the pearl, and at that moment,</p><br/><p>when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made</p><br/><p>for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only</p><br/><p>a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize,</p><br/><p>which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six</p><br/><p>plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them</p><br/><p>was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a</p><br/><p>small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a</p><br/><p>few touches covered over the aperture once more. It was an</p><br/><p>admirable hiding-place. No one could possibly find it. But Beppo</p><br/><p>was condemned to a year’s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his</p><br/><p>six busts were scattered over London. He could not tell which</p><br/><p>contained his treasure. Only by breaking them could he see. Even</p><br/><p>shaking would tell him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was</p><br/><p>probable that the pearl would adhere to it—as, in fact, it has</p><br/><p>done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with</p><br/><p>considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a cousin who</p><br/><p>works with Gelder, he found out the retail firms who had bought</p><br/><p>the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson, and</p><br/><p>in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.</p><br/><p>Then, with the help of some Italian employee, he succeeded in</p><br/><p>finding out where the other three busts had gone. The first was</p><br/><p>at Harker’s. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held</p><br/><p>Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him</p><br/><p>in the scuffle which followed.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?”</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“As a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him</p><br/><p>from any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after</p><br/><p>the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather</p><br/><p>than delay his movements. He would fear that the police would</p><br/><p>read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get</p><br/><p>ahead of him. Of course, I could not say that he had not found</p><br/><p>the pearl in Harker’s bust. I had not even concluded for certain</p><br/><p>that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was</p><br/><p>looking for something, since he carried the bust past the other</p><br/><p>houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp</p><br/><p>overlooking it. Since Harker’s bust was one in three, the chances</p><br/><p>were exactly as I told you—two to one against the pearl being</p><br/><p>inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he</p><br/><p>would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the</p><br/><p>house, so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with</p><br/><p>the happiest results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain</p><br/><p>that it was the Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the</p><br/><p>murdered man linked the one event with the other. There only</p><br/><p>remained a single bust—the Reading one—and the pearl must be</p><br/><p>there. I bought it in your presence from the owner—and there it</p><br/><p>lies.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>We sat in silence for a moment.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well,” said Lestrade, “I’ve seen you handle a good many cases,</p><br/><p>Mr. Holmes, but I don’t know that I ever knew a more workmanlike</p><br/><p>one than that. We’re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No,</p><br/><p>sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow,</p><br/><p>there’s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest</p><br/><p>constable, who wouldn’t be glad to shake you by the hand.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you!” said Holmes. “Thank you!” and as he turned away, it</p><br/><p>seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human</p><br/><p>emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold</p><br/><p>and practical thinker once more. “Put the pearl in the safe,</p><br/><p>Watson,” said he, “and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton</p><br/><p>forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes</p><br/><p>your way, I shall be happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two</p><br/><p>as to its solution.”</p><br/>
