             <p>The Red Headed League</p><br/><p></p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn</p><br/><p>of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout,</p><br/><p>florid-faced, elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an apology</p><br/><p>for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled me</p><br/><p>abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he</p><br/><p>said, cordially.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I was afraid that you were engaged.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“So I am. Very much so.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then I can wait in the next room.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper</p><br/><p>in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will</p><br/><p>be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The stout gentleman half-rose from his chair and gave a bob of</p><br/><p>greeting, with a quick, little, questioning glance from his small,</p><br/><p>fat-encircled eyes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair and putting</p><br/><p>his finger-tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I</p><br/><p>know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and</p><br/><p>outside the conventions and humdrum routine of every-day life. You have</p><br/><p>shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to</p><br/><p>chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish</p><br/><p>so many of my own little adventures.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I</p><br/><p>observed.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went</p><br/><p>into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that</p><br/><p>for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to</p><br/><p>life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the</p><br/><p>imagination.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view,</p><br/><p>for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your</p><br/><p>reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.</p><br/><p>Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,</p><br/><p>and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular</p><br/><p>which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that</p><br/><p>the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with</p><br/><p>the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where</p><br/><p>there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.</p><br/><p>As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the</p><br/><p>present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events</p><br/><p>is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence</p><br/><p>your narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has</p><br/><p>not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the</p><br/><p>story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.</p><br/><p>As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of</p><br/><p>events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar</p><br/><p>cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to</p><br/><p>admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some</p><br/><p>little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside</p><br/><p>pocket of his great-coat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,</p><br/><p>with his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his</p><br/><p>knee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after the fashion</p><br/><p>of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by</p><br/><p>his dress or appearance.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore</p><br/><p>every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,</p><br/><p>pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray shepherd’s check trousers,</p><br/><p>a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab</p><br/><p>waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of</p><br/><p>metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown</p><br/><p>overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.</p><br/><p>Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man</p><br/><p>save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and</p><br/><p>discontent upon his features.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes’s quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his</p><br/><p>head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the</p><br/><p>obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes</p><br/><p>snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he</p><br/><p>has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing</p><br/><p>else.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the</p><br/><p>paper, but his eyes upon my companion.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?”</p><br/><p>he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labor. It’s</p><br/><p>as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than</p><br/><p>your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,</p><br/><p>especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use</p><br/><p>an arc-and-compass breastpin.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five</p><br/><p>inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you</p><br/><p>rest it upon the desk.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, but China?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist</p><br/><p>could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo</p><br/><p>marks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.</p><br/><p>That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite</p><br/><p>peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from</p><br/><p>your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought</p><br/><p>at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was</p><br/><p>nothing in it, after all.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in</p><br/><p>explaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor little</p><br/><p>reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can</p><br/><p>you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered, with his thick, red finger</p><br/><p>planted half-way down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it</p><br/><p>all. You just read it for yourself, sir.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I took the paper from him, and read as follows:</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>  “TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the</p><br/><p>  late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now</p><br/><p>  another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League</p><br/><p>  to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services. All</p><br/><p>  red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above</p><br/><p>  the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on</p><br/><p>  Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of</p><br/><p>  the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated, after I had twice read</p><br/><p>over the extraordinary announcement.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in</p><br/><p>high spirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said</p><br/><p>he. “And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about</p><br/><p>yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had</p><br/><p>upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, doctor, of the paper</p><br/><p>and the date.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is _The Morning Chronicle_, of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”</p><br/><p>said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s</p><br/><p>business at Coburg Square, near the city. It’s not a very large affair,</p><br/><p>and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I</p><br/><p>used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I</p><br/><p>would have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half</p><br/><p>wages, so as to learn the business.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s</p><br/><p>hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;</p><br/><p>and I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what</p><br/><p>I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I</p><br/><p>put ideas in his head?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who</p><br/><p>comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among</p><br/><p>employers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as</p><br/><p>remarkable as your advertisement.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow</p><br/><p>for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be</p><br/><p>improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit</p><br/><p>into its hole to develope his pictures. That is his main fault; but, on</p><br/><p>the whole, he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He is still with you, I presume?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking,</p><br/><p>and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a</p><br/><p>widower, and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three</p><br/><p>of us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do</p><br/><p>nothing more.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he</p><br/><p>came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very</p><br/><p>paper in his hand, and he says:</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Why that?’ I asks.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the</p><br/><p>Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets</p><br/><p>it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,</p><br/><p>so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.</p><br/><p>If my hair would only change color, here’s a nice little crib all ready</p><br/><p>for me to step into.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very</p><br/><p>stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having</p><br/><p>to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the</p><br/><p>door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,</p><br/><p>and I was always glad of a bit of news.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked,</p><br/><p>with his eyes open.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Never.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the</p><br/><p>vacancies.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it</p><br/><p>need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the</p><br/><p>business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of</p><br/><p>hundred would have been very handy.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for</p><br/><p>yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address</p><br/><p>where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the</p><br/><p>League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who</p><br/><p>was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a</p><br/><p>great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found</p><br/><p>that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with</p><br/><p>instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to</p><br/><p>men whose hair is of that color. From all I hear it is splendid pay,</p><br/><p>and very little to do.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would</p><br/><p>apply.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really</p><br/><p>confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from</p><br/><p>London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.</p><br/><p>Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is</p><br/><p>light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery</p><br/><p>red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;</p><br/><p>but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of</p><br/><p>the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my</p><br/><p>hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if</p><br/><p>there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance</p><br/><p>as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so</p><br/><p>much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered</p><br/><p>him to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me.</p><br/><p>He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and</p><br/><p>started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From</p><br/><p>north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his</p><br/><p>hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet</p><br/><p>Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked</p><br/><p>like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were</p><br/><p>so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single</p><br/><p>advertisement. Every shade of color they were—straw, lemon, orange,</p><br/><p>brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were</p><br/><p>not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how many</p><br/><p>were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would</p><br/><p>not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and</p><br/><p>pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to</p><br/><p>the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the</p><br/><p>stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we</p><br/><p>wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes, as</p><br/><p>his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.</p><br/><p>“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a</p><br/><p>deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even</p><br/><p>redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came</p><br/><p>up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would</p><br/><p>disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy</p><br/><p>matter, after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was much</p><br/><p>more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door</p><br/><p>as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to</p><br/><p>fill a vacancy in the League.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every</p><br/><p>requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He</p><br/><p>took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair</p><br/><p>until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my</p><br/><p>hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am</p><br/><p>sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized</p><br/><p>my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.</p><br/><p>‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he, as he released me. ‘I perceive</p><br/><p>that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have</p><br/><p>twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales</p><br/><p>of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped</p><br/><p>over to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that</p><br/><p>the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,</p><br/><p>and the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was</p><br/><p>not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the</p><br/><p>pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a</p><br/><p>married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I answered that I had not.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“His face fell immediately.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Dear me!’ he said, gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry</p><br/><p>to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation</p><br/><p>and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is</p><br/><p>exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not</p><br/><p>to have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few</p><br/><p>minutes, he said that it would be all right.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but</p><br/><p>we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as</p><br/><p>yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I</p><br/><p>shall be able to look after that for you.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Ten to two.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,</p><br/><p>especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;</p><br/><p>so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.</p><br/><p>Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see</p><br/><p>to anything that turned up.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Is £4 a week.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘And the work?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Is purely nominal.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘What do you call purely nominal?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the</p><br/><p>whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.</p><br/><p>The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the</p><br/><p>conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said</p><br/><p>I.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross, ‘neither sickness nor</p><br/><p>business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your</p><br/><p>billet.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘And the work?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Is to copy out the “Encyclopædia Britannica.” There is the first</p><br/><p>volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and</p><br/><p>blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready</p><br/><p>to-morrow?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Certainly,’ I answered.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once</p><br/><p>more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to</p><br/><p>gain.’ He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant,</p><br/><p>hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good</p><br/><p>fortune.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in</p><br/><p>low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole</p><br/><p>affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might</p><br/><p>be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that any one</p><br/><p>could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing</p><br/><p>anything so simple as copying out the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica.’</p><br/><p>Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I</p><br/><p>had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning</p><br/><p>I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle</p><br/><p>of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I</p><br/><p>started off for Pope’s Court.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.</p><br/><p>The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to</p><br/><p>see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and</p><br/><p>then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all</p><br/><p>was right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me</p><br/><p>upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office</p><br/><p>after me.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager</p><br/><p>came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work.</p><br/><p>It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning</p><br/><p>I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.</p><br/><p>Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after</p><br/><p>a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to</p><br/><p>leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,</p><br/><p>and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would</p><br/><p>not risk the loss of it.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and</p><br/><p>Archery and Armor and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence</p><br/><p>that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something</p><br/><p>in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.</p><br/><p>And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“To an end?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual</p><br/><p>at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square</p><br/><p>of card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here</p><br/><p>it is, and you can read for yourself.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>He held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of</p><br/><p>note-paper. It read in this fashion:</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>  “THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</p><br/><p>   IS</p><br/><p>   DISSOLVED.</p><br/><p>   _October 9, 1890._”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful</p><br/><p>face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely</p><br/><p>overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar</p><br/><p>of laughter.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,</p><br/><p>flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing</p><br/><p>better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he</p><br/><p>had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is</p><br/><p>most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying</p><br/><p>so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you</p><br/><p>take when you found the card upon the door?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at</p><br/><p>the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.</p><br/><p>Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the</p><br/><p>ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of</p><br/><p>the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such</p><br/><p>body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the</p><br/><p>name was new to him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>[Illustration: “THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED”]</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘What, the red-headed man?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Yes.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor, and</p><br/><p>was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises</p><br/><p>were ready. He moved out yesterday.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Where could I find him?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King</p><br/><p>Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a</p><br/><p>manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of</p><br/><p>either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my</p><br/><p>assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that</p><br/><p>if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,</p><br/><p>Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,</p><br/><p>as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk</p><br/><p>who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly</p><br/><p>remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you</p><br/><p>have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from</p><br/><p>it than might at first sight appear.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a</p><br/><p>week.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not</p><br/><p>see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On</p><br/><p>the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £30, to say</p><br/><p>nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject</p><br/><p>which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what</p><br/><p>their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It</p><br/><p>was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty</p><br/><p>pounds.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And, first, one</p><br/><p>or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called</p><br/><p>your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“About a month then.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“How did he come?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“In answer to an advertisement.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Was he the only applicant?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, I had a dozen.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Why did you pick him?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Because he was handy, and would come cheap.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“At half-wages, in fact.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,</p><br/><p>though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his</p><br/><p>forehead.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as</p><br/><p>much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for</p><br/><p>earrings?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a</p><br/><p>lad.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with</p><br/><p>you?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh yes, sir; I have only just left him.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a</p><br/><p>morning.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon</p><br/><p>the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I</p><br/><p>hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, Watson,” said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, “what do you</p><br/><p>make of it all?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I make nothing of it,” I answered, frankly. “It is a most mysterious</p><br/><p>business.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less</p><br/><p>mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes</p><br/><p>which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most</p><br/><p>difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg</p><br/><p>that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up</p><br/><p>in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and</p><br/><p>there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out</p><br/><p>like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that</p><br/><p>he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly</p><br/><p>sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his</p><br/><p>mind, and put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked.</p><br/><p>“What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few</p><br/><p>hours?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the city first, and</p><br/><p>we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal</p><br/><p>of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than</p><br/><p>Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come</p><br/><p>along!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk</p><br/><p>took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we</p><br/><p>had listened to in the morning. It was a pokey, little, shabby-genteel</p><br/><p>place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out</p><br/><p>into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and</p><br/><p>a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a</p><br/><p>smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown</p><br/><p>board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner</p><br/><p>house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his</p><br/><p>business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one</p><br/><p>side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between</p><br/><p>puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again</p><br/><p>to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned</p><br/><p>to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement</p><br/><p>with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.</p><br/><p>It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow,</p><br/><p>who asked him to step in.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go</p><br/><p>from here to the Strand.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant, promptly, closing</p><br/><p>the door.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes, as we walked away. “He is, in my</p><br/><p>judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not</p><br/><p>sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him</p><br/><p>before.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in</p><br/><p>this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your</p><br/><p>way merely in order that you might see him.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Not him.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The knees of his trousers.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And what did you see?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What I expected to see.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Why did you beat the pavement?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are</p><br/><p>spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.</p><br/><p>Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner</p><br/><p>from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to</p><br/><p>it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main</p><br/><p>arteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west.</p><br/><p>The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing</p><br/><p>in a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black</p><br/><p>with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize</p><br/><p>as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises</p><br/><p>that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant</p><br/><p>square which we had just quitted.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along</p><br/><p>the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.</p><br/><p>It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is</p><br/><p>Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg</p><br/><p>branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and</p><br/><p>McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the</p><br/><p>other block. And now, doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had</p><br/><p>some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,</p><br/><p>where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no</p><br/><p>red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a</p><br/><p>very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the</p><br/><p>afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,</p><br/><p>gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his</p><br/><p>gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those</p><br/><p>of Holmes, the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,</p><br/><p>ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his</p><br/><p>singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and</p><br/><p>his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often</p><br/><p>thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which</p><br/><p>occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from</p><br/><p>extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never</p><br/><p>so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in</p><br/><p>his arm-chair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.</p><br/><p>Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,</p><br/><p>and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of</p><br/><p>intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would</p><br/><p>look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other</p><br/><p>mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enrapt in the music at St.</p><br/><p>James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom</p><br/><p>he had set himself to hunt down.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You want to go home, no doubt, doctor,” he remarked, as we emerged.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, it would be as well.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This</p><br/><p>business at Coburg Square is serious.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Why serious?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to</p><br/><p>believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday</p><br/><p>rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“At what time?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ten will be early enough.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Very well. And, I say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so</p><br/><p>kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand,</p><br/><p>turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>[Illustration: “ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS”]</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always</p><br/><p>oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock</p><br/><p>Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had</p><br/><p>seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not</p><br/><p>only what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the</p><br/><p>whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to</p><br/><p>my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary</p><br/><p>story of the red-headed copier of the “Encyclopædia” down to the visit</p><br/><p>to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted</p><br/><p>from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?</p><br/><p>Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes</p><br/><p>that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a</p><br/><p>man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it</p><br/><p>up in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an</p><br/><p>explanation.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way</p><br/><p>across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two</p><br/><p>hansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I</p><br/><p>heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found</p><br/><p>Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized</p><br/><p>as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long,</p><br/><p>thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable</p><br/><p>frock-coat.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ha! our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket,</p><br/><p>and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think</p><br/><p>you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.</p><br/><p>Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We’re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,” said Jones, in his</p><br/><p>consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a</p><br/><p>chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”</p><br/><p>observed Mr. Merryweather, gloomily.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the</p><br/><p>police agent, loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he</p><br/><p>won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,</p><br/><p>but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to</p><br/><p>say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and</p><br/><p>the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official</p><br/><p>force.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger,</p><br/><p>with deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the</p><br/><p>first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my</p><br/><p>rubber.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for</p><br/><p>a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play</p><br/><p>will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be</p><br/><p>some £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish</p><br/><p>to lay your hands.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,</p><br/><p>Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would</p><br/><p>rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a</p><br/><p>remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,</p><br/><p>and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as</p><br/><p>his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never</p><br/><p>know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one</p><br/><p>week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.</p><br/><p>I’ve been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve</p><br/><p>had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with</p><br/><p>you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,</p><br/><p>and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,</p><br/><p>Watson and I will follow in the second.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive,</p><br/><p>and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the</p><br/><p>afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets</p><br/><p>until we emerged into Farringdon Street.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather</p><br/><p>is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought</p><br/><p>it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though</p><br/><p>an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He</p><br/><p>is as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his</p><br/><p>claws upon any one. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found</p><br/><p>ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following</p><br/><p>the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage</p><br/><p>and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a</p><br/><p>small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was</p><br/><p>opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated</p><br/><p>at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a</p><br/><p>lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and</p><br/><p>so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was</p><br/><p>piled all round with crates and massive boxes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked, as he held</p><br/><p>up the lantern and gazed about him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the</p><br/><p>flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he</p><br/><p>remarked, looking up in surprise.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet,” said Holmes,</p><br/><p>severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our</p><br/><p>expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down</p><br/><p>upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very</p><br/><p>injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees</p><br/><p>upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to</p><br/><p>examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed</p><br/><p>to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in</p><br/><p>his pocket.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked; “for they can</p><br/><p>hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.</p><br/><p>Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work</p><br/><p>the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,</p><br/><p>doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch</p><br/><p>of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman</p><br/><p>of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the</p><br/><p>more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in</p><br/><p>this cellar at present.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several</p><br/><p>warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your French gold?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and</p><br/><p>borrowed, for that purpose, 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.</p><br/><p>It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the</p><br/><p>money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which</p><br/><p>I sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our</p><br/><p>reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a</p><br/><p>single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the</p><br/><p>subject.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time</p><br/><p>that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters</p><br/><p>will come to a head. In the mean time, Mr. Merryweather, we must put</p><br/><p>the screen over that dark lantern.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And sit in the dark?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I</p><br/><p>thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber</p><br/><p>after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far</p><br/><p>that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must</p><br/><p>choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take</p><br/><p>them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.</p><br/><p>I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind</p><br/><p>those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they</p><br/><p>fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind</p><br/><p>which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his</p><br/><p>lantern, and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness</p><br/><p>as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained</p><br/><p>to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at</p><br/><p>a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of</p><br/><p>expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden</p><br/><p>gloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through</p><br/><p>the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I</p><br/><p>asked you, Jones?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and</p><br/><p>wait.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an</p><br/><p>hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have</p><br/><p>almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and</p><br/><p>stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked</p><br/><p>up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I</p><br/><p>could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could</p><br/><p>distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the</p><br/><p>thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look</p><br/><p>over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught</p><br/><p>the glint of a light.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it</p><br/><p>lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any</p><br/><p>warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white,</p><br/><p>almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area</p><br/><p>of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,</p><br/><p>protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it</p><br/><p>appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which</p><br/><p>marked a chink between the stones.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing</p><br/><p>sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and</p><br/><p>left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a</p><br/><p>lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which</p><br/><p>looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the</p><br/><p>aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee</p><br/><p>rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the</p><br/><p>hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like</p><br/><p>himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags.</p><br/><p>Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.</p><br/><p>The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth</p><br/><p>as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a</p><br/><p>revolver, but Holmes’s hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and</p><br/><p>the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes, blandly. “You have no chance at</p><br/><p>all.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“So I see,” the other answered, with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that</p><br/><p>my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must</p><br/><p>compliment you.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and</p><br/><p>effective.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at</p><br/><p>climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked</p><br/><p>our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not</p><br/><p>be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,</p><br/><p>when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“All right,” said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you</p><br/><p>please, sir, march up-stairs, where we can get a cab to carry your</p><br/><p>highness to the police-station?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is better,” said John Clay, serenely. He made a sweeping bow to</p><br/><p>the three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Really Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from</p><br/><p>the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.</p><br/><p>There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most</p><br/><p>complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery</p><br/><p>that have ever come within my experience.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.</p><br/><p>John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this</p><br/><p>matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am</p><br/><p>amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,</p><br/><p>and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>       *       *       *       *       *</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You see, Watson,” he explained, in the early hours of the morning,</p><br/><p>as we sat over a glass of whiskey-and-soda in Baker Street, “it was</p><br/><p>perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this</p><br/><p>rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the</p><br/><p>copying of the ‘Encyclopædia,’ must be to get this not over-bright</p><br/><p>pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a</p><br/><p>curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to</p><br/><p>suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious</p><br/><p>mind by the color of his accomplice’s hair. The £4 a week was a lure</p><br/><p>which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for</p><br/><p>thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary</p><br/><p>office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together</p><br/><p>they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From</p><br/><p>the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages,</p><br/><p>it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the</p><br/><p>situation.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But how could you guess what the motive was?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere</p><br/><p>vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s</p><br/><p>business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which</p><br/><p>could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure</p><br/><p>as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What</p><br/><p>could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography,</p><br/><p>and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the</p><br/><p>end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious</p><br/><p>assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest</p><br/><p>and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the</p><br/><p>cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What</p><br/><p>could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was</p><br/><p>running a tunnel to some other building.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I</p><br/><p>surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was</p><br/><p>ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.</p><br/><p>It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the</p><br/><p>assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never</p><br/><p>set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His</p><br/><p>knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how</p><br/><p>worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of</p><br/><p>burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I</p><br/><p>walked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on</p><br/><p>our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you</p><br/><p>drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the</p><br/><p>chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I</p><br/><p>asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they</p><br/><p>cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words,</p><br/><p>that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they</p><br/><p>should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might</p><br/><p>be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it</p><br/><p>would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I</p><br/><p>expected them to come to-night.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed, in unfeigned</p><br/><p>admiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel</p><br/><p>it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape</p><br/><p>from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do</p><br/><p>so.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>He shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some</p><br/><p>little use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est</p><br/><p>tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sand.”</p><br/><p></p><br/>
