             <p>The Naval Treaty</p><br/><p></p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made</p><br/><p>memorable by three cases of interest, in which I had the</p><br/><p>privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of</p><br/><p>studying his methods. I find them recorded in my notes under the</p><br/><p>headings of “The Adventure of the Second Stain,” “The Adventure</p><br/><p>of the Naval Treaty,” and “The Adventure of the Tired Captain.”</p><br/><p>The first of these, however, deals with interest of such</p><br/><p>importance and implicates so many of the first families in the</p><br/><p>kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it</p><br/><p>public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has ever</p><br/><p>illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has</p><br/><p>impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still</p><br/><p>retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he</p><br/><p>demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubuque of</p><br/><p>the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known</p><br/><p>specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies</p><br/><p>upon what proved to be side-issues. The new century will have</p><br/><p>come, however, before the story can be safely told. Meanwhile I</p><br/><p>pass on to the second on my list, which promised also at one time</p><br/><p>to be of national importance, and was marked by several incidents</p><br/><p>which give it a quite unique character.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad</p><br/><p>named Percy Phelps, who was of much the same age as myself,</p><br/><p>though he was two classes ahead of me. He was a very brilliant</p><br/><p>boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer,</p><br/><p>finished his exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on</p><br/><p>to continue his triumphant career at Cambridge. He was, I</p><br/><p>remember, extremely well connected, and even when we were all</p><br/><p>little boys together we knew that his mother’s brother was Lord</p><br/><p>Holdhurst, the great conservative politician. This gaudy</p><br/><p>relationship did him little good at school. On the contrary, it</p><br/><p>seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the</p><br/><p>playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. But it was</p><br/><p>another thing when he came out into the world. I heard vaguely</p><br/><p>that his abilities and the influences which he commanded had won</p><br/><p>him a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed</p><br/><p>completely out of my mind until the following letter recalled his</p><br/><p>existence:</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Briarbrae, Woking.</p><br/><p>    My dear Watson,—I have no doubt that you can remember</p><br/><p>    “Tadpole” Phelps, who was in the fifth form when you were in</p><br/><p>    the third. It is possible even that you may have heard that</p><br/><p>    through my uncle’s influence I obtained a good appointment at</p><br/><p>    the Foreign Office, and that I was in a situation of trust</p><br/><p>    and honour until a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast</p><br/><p>    my career.</p><br/><p>    There is no use writing of the details of that dreadful</p><br/><p>    event. In the event of your acceding to my request it is</p><br/><p>    probable that I shall have to narrate them to you. I have</p><br/><p>    only just recovered from nine weeks of brain-fever, and am</p><br/><p>    still exceedingly weak. Do you think that you could bring</p><br/><p>    your friend Mr. Holmes down to see me? I should like to have</p><br/><p>    his opinion of the case, though the authorities assure me</p><br/><p>    that nothing more can be done. Do try to bring him down, and</p><br/><p>    as soon as possible. Every minute seems an hour while I live</p><br/><p>    in this state of horrible suspense. Assure him that if I have</p><br/><p>    not asked his advice sooner it was not because I did not</p><br/><p>    appreciate his talents, but because I have been off my head</p><br/><p>    ever since the blow fell. Now I am clear again, though I dare</p><br/><p>    not think of it too much for fear of a relapse. I am still so</p><br/><p>    weak that I have to write, as you see, by dictating. Do try</p><br/><p>    to bring him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Your old schoolfellow,</p><br/><p>Percy Phelps.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>There was something that touched me as I read this letter,</p><br/><p>something pitiable in the reiterated appeals to bring Holmes. So</p><br/><p>moved was I that even had it been a difficult matter I should</p><br/><p>have tried it, but of course I knew well that Holmes loved his</p><br/><p>art, so that he was ever as ready to bring his aid as his client</p><br/><p>could be to receive it. My wife agreed with me that not a moment</p><br/><p>should be lost in laying the matter before him, and so within an</p><br/><p>hour of breakfast-time I found myself back once more in the old</p><br/><p>rooms in Baker Street.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown,</p><br/><p>and working hard over a chemical investigation. A large curved</p><br/><p>retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen</p><br/><p>burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre</p><br/><p>measure. My friend hardly glanced up as I entered, and I, seeing</p><br/><p>that his investigation must be of importance, seated myself in an</p><br/><p>armchair and waited. He dipped into this bottle or that, drawing</p><br/><p>out a few drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally</p><br/><p>brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. In</p><br/><p>his right hand he held a slip of litmus-paper.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You come at a crisis, Watson,” said he. “If this paper remains</p><br/><p>blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a man’s life.” He</p><br/><p>dipped it into the test-tube and it flushed at once into a dull,</p><br/><p>dirty crimson. “Hum! I thought as much!” he cried. “I will be at</p><br/><p>your service in an instant, Watson. You will find tobacco in the</p><br/><p>Persian slipper.” He turned to his desk and scribbled off several</p><br/><p>telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy. Then he threw</p><br/><p>himself down into the chair opposite, and drew up his knees until</p><br/><p>his fingers clasped round his long, thin shins.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“A very commonplace little murder,” said he. “You’ve got</p><br/><p>something better, I fancy. You are the stormy petrel of crime,</p><br/><p>Watson. What is it?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I handed him the letter, which he read with the most concentrated</p><br/><p>attention.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It does not tell us very much, does it?” he remarked, as he</p><br/><p>handed it back to me.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Hardly anything.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And yet the writing is of interest.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But the writing is not his own.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Precisely. It is a woman’s.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“A man’s surely,” I cried.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, a woman’s, and a woman of rare character. You see, at the</p><br/><p>commencement of an investigation it is something to know that</p><br/><p>your client is in close contact with some one who, for good or</p><br/><p>evil, has an exceptional nature. My interest is already awakened</p><br/><p>in the case. If you are ready we will start at once for Woking,</p><br/><p>and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case, and the lady</p><br/><p>to whom he dictates his letters.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>We were fortunate enough to catch an early train at Waterloo, and</p><br/><p>in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods</p><br/><p>and the heather of Woking. Briarbrae proved to be a large</p><br/><p>detached house standing in extensive grounds within a few</p><br/><p>minutes’ walk of the station. On sending in our cards we were</p><br/><p>shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were</p><br/><p>joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man who received us</p><br/><p>with much hospitality. His age may have been nearer forty than</p><br/><p>thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that</p><br/><p>he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I am so glad that you have come,” said he, shaking our hands</p><br/><p>with effusion. “Percy has been inquiring for you all morning. Ah,</p><br/><p>poor old chap, he clings to any straw! His father and his mother</p><br/><p>asked me to see you, for the mere mention of the subject is very</p><br/><p>painful to them.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We have had no details yet,” observed Holmes. “I perceive that</p><br/><p>you are not yourself a member of the family.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Our acquaintance looked surprised, and then, glancing down, he</p><br/><p>began to laugh.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Of course you saw the ‘J.H.’ monogram on my locket,” said he.</p><br/><p>“For a moment I thought you had done something clever. Joseph</p><br/><p>Harrison is my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister Annie I</p><br/><p>shall at least be a relation by marriage. You will find my sister</p><br/><p>in his room, for she has nursed him hand-and-foot this two months</p><br/><p>back. Perhaps we’d better go in at once, for I know how impatient</p><br/><p>he is.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The chamber in which we were shown was on the same floor as the</p><br/><p>drawing-room. It was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as</p><br/><p>a bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and</p><br/><p>corner. A young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa</p><br/><p>near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the</p><br/><p>garden and the balmy summer air. A woman was sitting beside him,</p><br/><p>who rose as we entered.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Shall I leave, Percy?” she asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>He clutched her hand to detain her. “How are you, Watson?” said</p><br/><p>he, cordially. “I should never have known you under that</p><br/><p>moustache, and I daresay you would not be prepared to swear to</p><br/><p>me. This I presume is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sherlock</p><br/><p>Holmes?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I introduced him in a few words, and we both sat down. The stout</p><br/><p>young man had left us, but his sister still remained with her</p><br/><p>hand in that of the invalid. She was a striking-looking woman, a</p><br/><p>little short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful olive</p><br/><p>complexion, large, dark, Italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black</p><br/><p>hair. Her rich tints made the white face of her companion the</p><br/><p>more worn and haggard by the contrast.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I won’t waste your time,” said he, raising himself upon the</p><br/><p>sofa. “I’ll plunge into the matter without further preamble. I</p><br/><p>was a happy and successful man, Mr. Holmes, and on the eve of</p><br/><p>being married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all</p><br/><p>my prospects in life.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I was, as Watson may have told you, in the Foreign Office, and</p><br/><p>through the influences of my uncle, Lord Holdhurst, I rose</p><br/><p>rapidly to a responsible position. When my uncle became foreign</p><br/><p>minister in this administration he gave me several missions of</p><br/><p>trust, and as I always brought them to a successful conclusion,</p><br/><p>he came at last to have the utmost confidence in my ability and</p><br/><p>tact.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Nearly ten weeks ago—to be more accurate, on the 23rd of May—he</p><br/><p>called me into his private room, and, after complimenting me on</p><br/><p>the good work which I had done, he informed me that he had a new</p><br/><p>commission of trust for me to execute.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘This,’ said he, taking a grey roll of paper from his bureau,</p><br/><p>‘is the original of that secret treaty between England and Italy</p><br/><p>of which, I regret to say, some rumours have already got into the</p><br/><p>public press. It is of enormous importance that nothing further</p><br/><p>should leak out. The French or the Russian embassy would pay an</p><br/><p>immense sum to learn the contents of these papers. They should</p><br/><p>not leave my bureau were it not that it is absolutely necessary</p><br/><p>to have them copied. You have a desk in your office?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Then take the treaty and lock it up there. I shall give</p><br/><p>directions that you may remain behind when the others go, so that</p><br/><p>you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked.</p><br/><p>When you have finished, relock both the original and the draft in</p><br/><p>the desk, and hand them over to me personally to-morrow morning.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I took the papers and—”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Excuse me an instant,” said Holmes. “Were you alone during this</p><br/><p>conversation?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Absolutely.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“In a large room?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thirty feet each way.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“In the centre?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, about it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And speaking low?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My uncle’s voice is always remarkably low. I hardly spoke at</p><br/><p>all.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes; “pray go on.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I did exactly what he indicated, and waited until the other</p><br/><p>clerks had departed. One of them in my room, Charles Gorot, had</p><br/><p>some arrears of work to make up, so I left him there and went out</p><br/><p>to dine. When I returned he was gone. I was anxious to hurry my</p><br/><p>work, for I knew that Joseph—the Mr. Harrison whom you saw just</p><br/><p>now—was in town, and that he would travel down to Woking by the</p><br/><p>eleven o’clock train, and I wanted if possible to catch it.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“When I came to examine the treaty I saw at once that it was of</p><br/><p>such importance that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration</p><br/><p>in what he had said. Without going into details, I may say that</p><br/><p>it defined the position of Great Britain towards the Triple</p><br/><p>Alliance, and fore-shadowed the policy which this country would</p><br/><p>pursue in the event of the French fleet gaining a complete</p><br/><p>ascendancy over that of Italy in the Mediterranean. The questions</p><br/><p>treated in it were purely naval. At the end were the signatures</p><br/><p>of the high dignitaries who had signed it. I glanced my eyes over</p><br/><p>it, and then settled down to my task of copying.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It was a long document, written in the French language, and</p><br/><p>containing twenty-six separate articles. I copied as quickly as I</p><br/><p>could, but at nine o’clock I had only done nine articles, and it</p><br/><p>seemed hopeless for me to attempt to catch my train. I was</p><br/><p>feeling drowsy and stupid, partly from my dinner and also from</p><br/><p>the effects of a long day’s work. A cup of coffee would clear my</p><br/><p>brain. A commissionnaire remains all night in a little lodge at</p><br/><p>the foot of the stairs, and is in the habit of making coffee at</p><br/><p>his spirit-lamp for any of the officials who may be working over</p><br/><p>time. I rang the bell, therefore, to summon him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“To my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons, a</p><br/><p>large, coarse-faced, elderly woman, in an apron. She explained</p><br/><p>that she was the commissionnaire’s wife, who did the charing, and</p><br/><p>I gave her the order for the coffee.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I wrote two more articles and then, feeling more drowsy than</p><br/><p>ever, I rose and walked up and down the room to stretch my legs.</p><br/><p>My coffee had not yet come, and I wondered what the cause of the</p><br/><p>delay could be. Opening the door, I started down the corridor to</p><br/><p>find out. There was a straight passage, dimly lighted, which led</p><br/><p>from the room in which I had been working, and was the only exit</p><br/><p>from it. It ended in a curving staircase, with the</p><br/><p>commissionnaire’s lodge in the passage at the bottom. Half-way</p><br/><p>down this staircase is a small landing, with another passage</p><br/><p>running into it at right angles. This second one leads by means</p><br/><p>of a second small stair to a side door, used by servants, and</p><br/><p>also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street.</p><br/><p>Here is a rough chart of the place.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>rough chart</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you. I think that I quite follow you,” said Sherlock</p><br/><p>Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is of the utmost importance that you should notice this</p><br/><p>point. I went down the stairs and into the hall, where I found</p><br/><p>the commissionnaire fast asleep in his box, with the kettle</p><br/><p>boiling furiously upon the spirit-lamp. I took off the kettle and</p><br/><p>blew out the lamp, for the water was spurting over the floor.</p><br/><p>Then I put out my hand and was about to shake the man, who was</p><br/><p>still sleeping soundly, when a bell over his head rang loudly,</p><br/><p>and he woke with a start.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Mr. Phelps, sir!’ said he, looking at me in bewilderment.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘I came down to see if my coffee was ready.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘I was boiling the kettle when I fell asleep, sir.’ He looked at</p><br/><p>me and then up at the still quivering bell with an ever-growing</p><br/><p>astonishment upon his face.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘If you was here, sir, then who rang the bell?’ he asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘The bell!’ I cried. ‘What bell is it?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘It’s the bell of the room you were working in.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“A cold hand seemed to close round my heart. Some one, then, was</p><br/><p>in that room where my precious treaty lay upon the table. I ran</p><br/><p>frantically up the stairs and along the passage. There was no one</p><br/><p>in the corridors, Mr. Holmes. There was no one in the room. All</p><br/><p>was exactly as I left it, save only that the papers which had</p><br/><p>been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which</p><br/><p>they lay. The copy was there, and the original was gone.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes sat up in his chair and rubbed his hands. I could see that</p><br/><p>the problem was entirely to his heart. “Pray, what did you do</p><br/><p>then?” he murmured.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I recognised in an instant that the thief must have come up the</p><br/><p>stairs from the side door. Of course I must have met him if he</p><br/><p>had come the other way.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You were satisfied that he could not have been concealed in the</p><br/><p>room all the time, or in the corridor which you have just</p><br/><p>described as dimly lighted?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is absolutely impossible. A rat could not conceal himself</p><br/><p>either in the room or the corridor. There is no cover at all.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you. Pray proceed.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The commissionnaire, seeing by my pale face that something was</p><br/><p>to be feared, had followed me upstairs. Now we both rushed along</p><br/><p>the corridor and down the steep steps which led to Charles</p><br/><p>Street. The door at the bottom was closed, but unlocked. We flung</p><br/><p>it open and rushed out. I can distinctly remember that as we did</p><br/><p>so there came three chimes from a neighbouring clock. It was</p><br/><p>quarter to ten.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is of enormous importance,” said Holmes, making a note upon</p><br/><p>his shirt-cuff.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The night was very dark, and a thin, warm rain was falling.</p><br/><p>There was no one in Charles Street, but a great traffic was going</p><br/><p>on, as usual, in Whitehall, at the extremity. We rushed along the</p><br/><p>pavement, bare-headed as we were, and at the far corner we found</p><br/><p>a policeman standing.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘A robbery has been committed,’ I gasped. ‘A document of immense</p><br/><p>value has been stolen from the Foreign Office. Has any one passed</p><br/><p>this way?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘I have been standing here for a quarter of an hour, sir,’ said</p><br/><p>he; ‘only one person has passed during that time—a woman, tall</p><br/><p>and elderly, with a Paisley shawl.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Ah, that is only my wife,’ cried the commissionnaire; ‘has no</p><br/><p>one else passed?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘No one.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Then it must be the other way that the thief took,’ cried the</p><br/><p>fellow, tugging at my sleeve.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘But I was not satisfied, and the attempts which he made to draw</p><br/><p>me away increased my suspicions.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Which way did the woman go?’ I cried.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘I don’t know, sir. I noticed her pass, but I had no special</p><br/><p>reason for watching her. She seemed to be in a hurry.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘How long ago was it?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Oh, not very many minutes.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Within the last five?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Well, it could not be more than five.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘You’re only wasting your time, sir, and every minute now is of</p><br/><p>importance,’ cried the commissionnaire; ‘take my word for it that</p><br/><p>my old woman has nothing to do with it, and come down to the</p><br/><p>other end of the street. Well, if you won’t, I will.’ And with</p><br/><p>that he rushed off in the other direction.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But I was after him in an instant and caught him by the sleeve.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Where do you live?’ said I.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘16 Ivy Lane, Brixton,’ he answered. ‘But don’t let yourself be</p><br/><p>drawn away upon a false scent, Mr. Phelps. Come to the other end</p><br/><p>of the street and let us see if we can hear of anything.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Nothing was to be lost by following his advice. With the</p><br/><p>policeman we both hurried down, but only to find the street full</p><br/><p>of traffic, many people coming and going, but all only too eager</p><br/><p>to get to a place of safety upon so wet a night. There was no</p><br/><p>lounger who could tell us who had passed.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then we returned to the office, and searched the stairs and the</p><br/><p>passage without result. The corridor which led to the room was</p><br/><p>laid down with a kind of creamy linoleum which shows an</p><br/><p>impression very easily. We examined it very carefully, but found</p><br/><p>no outline of any footmark.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Had it been raining all evening?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Since about seven.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“How is it, then, that the woman who came into the room about</p><br/><p>nine left no traces with her muddy boots?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I am glad you raised the point. It occurred to me at the time.</p><br/><p>The charwomen are in the habit of taking off their boots at the</p><br/><p>commissionnaire’s office, and putting on list slippers.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is very clear. There were no marks, then, though the night</p><br/><p>was a wet one? The chain of events is certainly one of</p><br/><p>extraordinary interest. What did you do next?</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We examined the room also. There is no possibility of a secret</p><br/><p>door, and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground. Both</p><br/><p>of them were fastened on the inside. The carpet prevents any</p><br/><p>possibility of a trap-door, and the ceiling is of the ordinary</p><br/><p>whitewashed kind. I will pledge my life that whoever stole my</p><br/><p>papers could only have come through the door.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“How about the fireplace?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“They use none. There is a stove. The bell-rope hangs from the</p><br/><p>wire just to the right of my desk. Whoever rang it must have come</p><br/><p>right up to the desk to do it. But why should any criminal wish</p><br/><p>to ring the bell? It is a most insoluble mystery.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Certainly the incident was unusual. What were your next steps?</p><br/><p>You examined the room, I presume, to see if the intruder had left</p><br/><p>any traces—any cigar-end or dropped glove or hairpin or other</p><br/><p>trifle?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There was nothing of the sort.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No smell?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, we never thought of that.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, a scent of tobacco would have been worth a great deal to us</p><br/><p>in such an investigation.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I never smoke myself, so I think I should have observed it if</p><br/><p>there had been any smell of tobacco. There was absolutely no clue</p><br/><p>of any kind. The only tangible fact was that the</p><br/><p>commissionnaire’s wife—Mrs. Tangey was the name—had hurried out</p><br/><p>of the place. He could give no explanation save that it was about</p><br/><p>the time when the woman always went home. The policeman and I</p><br/><p>agreed that our best plan would be to seize the woman before she</p><br/><p>could get rid of the papers, presuming that she had them.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The alarm had reached Scotland Yard by this time, and Mr.</p><br/><p>Forbes, the detective, came round at once and took up the case</p><br/><p>with a great deal of energy. We hired a hansom, and in half an</p><br/><p>hour we were at the address which had been given to us. A young</p><br/><p>woman opened the door, who proved to be Mrs. Tangey’s eldest</p><br/><p>daughter. Her mother had not come back yet, and we were shown</p><br/><p>into the front room to wait.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“About ten minutes later a knock came at the door, and here we</p><br/><p>made the one serious mistake for which I blame myself. Instead of</p><br/><p>opening the door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. We</p><br/><p>heard her say, ‘Mother, there are two men in the house waiting to</p><br/><p>see you,’ and an instant afterwards we heard the patter of feet</p><br/><p>rushing down the passage. Forbes flung open the door, and we both</p><br/><p>ran into the back room or kitchen, but the woman had got there</p><br/><p>before us. She stared at us with defiant eyes, and then, suddenly</p><br/><p>recognising me, an expression of absolute astonishment came over</p><br/><p>her face.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Why, if it isn’t Mr. Phelps, of the office!’ she cried.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from</p><br/><p>us?’ asked my companion.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘I thought you were the brokers,’ said she, ‘we have had some</p><br/><p>trouble with a tradesman.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘That’s not quite good enough,’ answered Forbes. ‘We have reason</p><br/><p>to believe that you have taken a paper of importance from the</p><br/><p>Foreign Office, and that you ran in here to dispose of it. You</p><br/><p>must come back with us to Scotland Yard to be searched.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It was in vain that she protested and resisted. A four-wheeler</p><br/><p>was brought, and we all three drove back in it. We had first made</p><br/><p>an examination of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen</p><br/><p>fire, to see whether she might have made away with the papers</p><br/><p>during the instant that she was alone. There were no signs,</p><br/><p>however, of any ashes or scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard</p><br/><p>she was handed over at once to the female searcher. I waited in</p><br/><p>an agony of suspense until she came back with her report. There</p><br/><p>were no signs of the papers.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then for the first time the horror of my situation came in its</p><br/><p>full force. Hitherto I had been acting, and action had numbed</p><br/><p>thought. I had been so confident of regaining the treaty at once</p><br/><p>that I had not dared to think of what would be the consequence if</p><br/><p>I failed to do so. But now there was nothing more to be done, and</p><br/><p>I had leisure to realize my position. It was horrible. Watson</p><br/><p>there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at</p><br/><p>school. It is my nature. I thought of my uncle and of his</p><br/><p>colleagues in the Cabinet, of the shame which I had brought upon</p><br/><p>him, upon myself, upon every one connected with me. What though I</p><br/><p>was the victim of an extraordinary accident? No allowance is made</p><br/><p>for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. I was</p><br/><p>ruined, shamefully, hopelessly ruined. I don’t know what I did. I</p><br/><p>fancy I must have made a scene. I have a dim recollection of a</p><br/><p>group of officials who crowded round me, endeavouring to soothe</p><br/><p>me. One of them drove down with me to Waterloo, and saw me into</p><br/><p>the Woking train. I believe that he would have come all the way</p><br/><p>had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives near me, was going</p><br/><p>down by that very train. The doctor most kindly took charge of</p><br/><p>me, and it was well he did so, for I had a fit in the station,</p><br/><p>and before we reached home I was practically a raving maniac.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You can imagine the state of things here when they were roused</p><br/><p>from their beds by the doctor’s ringing and found me in this</p><br/><p>condition. Poor Annie here and my mother were broken-hearted. Dr.</p><br/><p>Ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at the station</p><br/><p>to be able to give an idea of what had happened, and his story</p><br/><p>did not mend matters. It was evident to all that I was in for a</p><br/><p>long illness, so Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom,</p><br/><p>and it was turned into a sick-room for me. Here I have lain, Mr.</p><br/><p>Holmes, for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with</p><br/><p>brain-fever. If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for</p><br/><p>the doctor’s care I should not be speaking to you now. She has</p><br/><p>nursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked after me by night,</p><br/><p>for in my mad fits I was capable of anything. Slowly my reason</p><br/><p>has cleared, but it is only during the last three days that my</p><br/><p>memory has quite returned. Sometimes I wish that it never had.</p><br/><p>The first thing that I did was to wire to Mr. Forbes, who had the</p><br/><p>case in hand. He came out, and assures me that, though everything</p><br/><p>has been done, no trace of a clue has been discovered. The</p><br/><p>commissionnaire and his wife have been examined in every way</p><br/><p>without any light being thrown upon the matter. The suspicions of</p><br/><p>the police then rested upon young Gorot, who, as you may</p><br/><p>remember, stayed over time in the office that night. His</p><br/><p>remaining behind and his French name were really the only two</p><br/><p>points which could suggest suspicion; but, as a matter of fact, I</p><br/><p>did not begin work until he had gone, and his people are of</p><br/><p>Huguenot extraction, but as English in sympathy and tradition as</p><br/><p>you and I are. Nothing was found to implicate him in any way, and</p><br/><p>there the matter dropped. I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as</p><br/><p>absolutely my last hope. If you fail me, then my honour as well</p><br/><p>as my position are forever forfeited.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired out by this long</p><br/><p>recital, while his nurse poured him out a glass of some</p><br/><p>stimulating medicine. Holmes sat silently, with his head thrown</p><br/><p>back and his eyes closed, in an attitude which might seem</p><br/><p>listless to a stranger, but which I knew betokened the most</p><br/><p>intense self-absorption.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You statement has been so explicit,” said he at last, “that you</p><br/><p>have really left me very few questions to ask. There is one of</p><br/><p>the very utmost importance, however. Did you tell any one that</p><br/><p>you had this special task to perform?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No one.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Not Miss Harrison here, for example?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No. I had not been back to Woking between getting the order and</p><br/><p>executing the commission.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And none of your people had by chance been to see you?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“None.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Did any of them know their way about in the office?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, yes, all of them had been shown over it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Still, of course, if you said nothing to any one about the</p><br/><p>treaty these inquiries are irrelevant.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I said nothing.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Nothing except that he is an old soldier.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What regiment?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, I have heard—Coldstream Guards.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you. I have no doubt I can get details from Forbes. The</p><br/><p>authorities are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not</p><br/><p>always use them to advantage. What a lovely thing a rose is!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>He walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the</p><br/><p>drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend</p><br/><p>of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me,</p><br/><p>for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural</p><br/><p>objects.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in</p><br/><p>religion,” said he, leaning with his back against the shutters.</p><br/><p>“It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our</p><br/><p>highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to</p><br/><p>rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers our desires,</p><br/><p>our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first</p><br/><p>instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are</p><br/><p>an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only</p><br/><p>goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much</p><br/><p>to hope from the flowers.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Percy Phelps and his nurse looked at Holmes during this</p><br/><p>demonstration with surprise and a good deal of disappointment</p><br/><p>written upon their faces. He had fallen into a reverie, with the</p><br/><p>moss-rose between his fingers. It had lasted some minutes before</p><br/><p>the young lady broke in upon it.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?”</p><br/><p>she asked, with a touch of asperity in her voice.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, the mystery!” he answered, coming back with a start to the</p><br/><p>realities of life. “Well, it would be absurd to deny that the</p><br/><p>case is a very abstruse and complicated one, but I can promise</p><br/><p>you that I will look into the matter and let you know any points</p><br/><p>which may strike me.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Do you see any clue?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You have furnished me with seven, but, of course, I must test</p><br/><p>them before I can pronounce upon their value.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You suspect some one?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I suspect myself.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Of coming to conclusions too rapidly.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then go to London and test your conclusions.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your advice is very excellent, Miss Harrison,” said Holmes,</p><br/><p>rising. “I think, Watson, we cannot do better. Do not allow</p><br/><p>yourself to indulge in false hopes, Mr. Phelps. The affair is a</p><br/><p>very tangled one.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I shall be in a fever until I see you again,” cried the</p><br/><p>diplomatist.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, I’ll come out by the same train to-morrow, though it’s</p><br/><p>more than likely that my report will be a negative one.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“God bless you for promising to come,” cried our client. “It</p><br/><p>gives me fresh life to know that something is being done. By the</p><br/><p>way, I have had a letter from Lord Holdhurst.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ha! What did he say?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He was cold, but not harsh. I daresay my severe illness</p><br/><p>prevented him from being that. He repeated that the matter was of</p><br/><p>the utmost importance, and added that no steps would be taken</p><br/><p>about my future—by which he means, of course, my dismissal—until</p><br/><p>my health was restored and I had an opportunity of repairing my</p><br/><p>misfortune.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, that was reasonable and considerate,” said Holmes. “Come,</p><br/><p>Watson, for we have a good day’s work before us in town.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Mr. Joseph Harrison drove us down to the station, and we were</p><br/><p>soon whirling up in a Portsmouth train. Holmes was sunk in</p><br/><p>profound thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we had passed</p><br/><p>Clapham Junction.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It’s a very cheery thing to come into London by any of these</p><br/><p>lines which run high, and allow you to look down upon the houses</p><br/><p>like this.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I thought he was joking, for the view was sordid enough, but he</p><br/><p>soon explained himself.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Look at those big, isolated clumps of building rising up above</p><br/><p>the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The board-schools.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Light-houses, my boy! Beacons of the future! Capsules with</p><br/><p>hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring</p><br/><p>the wise, better England of the future. I suppose that man Phelps</p><br/><p>does not drink?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I should not think so.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Nor should I, but we are bound to take every possibility into</p><br/><p>account. The poor devil has certainly got himself into very deep</p><br/><p>water, and it’s a question whether we shall ever be able to get</p><br/><p>him ashore. What did you think of Miss Harrison?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“A girl of strong character.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, but she is a good sort, or I am mistaken. She and her</p><br/><p>brother are the only children of an iron-master somewhere up</p><br/><p>Northumberland way. He got engaged to her when traveling last</p><br/><p>winter, and she came down to be introduced to his people, with</p><br/><p>her brother as escort. Then came the smash, and she stayed on to</p><br/><p>nurse her lover, while brother Joseph, finding himself pretty</p><br/><p>snug, stayed on too. I’ve been making a few independent</p><br/><p>inquiries, you see. But to-day must be a day of inquiries.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My practice—” I began.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, if you find your own cases more interesting than mine—” said</p><br/><p>Holmes, with some asperity.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I was going to say that my practice could get along very well</p><br/><p>for a day or two, since it is the slackest time in the year.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Excellent,” said he, recovering his good-humour. “Then we’ll</p><br/><p>look into this matter together. I think that we should begin by</p><br/><p>seeing Forbes. He can probably tell us all the details we want</p><br/><p>until we know from what side the case is to be approached.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You said you had a clue?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, we have several, but we can only test their value by</p><br/><p>further inquiry. The most difficult crime to track is the one</p><br/><p>which is purposeless. Now this is not purposeless. Who is it who</p><br/><p>profits by it? There is the French ambassador, there is the</p><br/><p>Russian, there is whoever might sell it to either of these, and</p><br/><p>there is Lord Holdhurst.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Lord Holdhurst!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself</p><br/><p>in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document</p><br/><p>accidentally destroyed.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Not a statesman with the honourable record of Lord Holdhurst?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is a possibility and we cannot afford to disregard it. We</p><br/><p>shall see the noble lord to-day and find out if he can tell us</p><br/><p>anything. Meanwhile I have already set inquiries on foot.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Already?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, I sent wires from Woking station to every evening paper in</p><br/><p>London. This advertisement will appear in each of them.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>He handed over a sheet torn from a note-book. On it was scribbled</p><br/><p>in pencil:</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“£10 Reward.—The number of the cab which dropped a fare at or</p><br/><p>about the door of the Foreign Office in Charles Street at quarter</p><br/><p>to ten in the evening of May 23rd. Apply 221B, Baker Street.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You are confident that the thief came in a cab?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“If not, there is no harm done. But if Mr. Phelps is correct in</p><br/><p>stating that there is no hiding-place either in the room or the</p><br/><p>corridors, then the person must have come from outside. If he</p><br/><p>came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of</p><br/><p>damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes</p><br/><p>of his passing, then it is exceeding probable that he came in a</p><br/><p>cab. Yes, I think that we may safely deduce a cab.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It sounds plausible.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is one of the clues of which I spoke. It may lead us to</p><br/><p>something. And then, of course, there is the bell—which is the</p><br/><p>most distinctive feature of the case. Why should the bell ring?</p><br/><p>Was it the thief who did it out of bravado? Or was it some one</p><br/><p>who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime?</p><br/><p>Or was it an accident? Or was it—?” He sank back into the state</p><br/><p>of intense and silent thought from which he had emerged; but it</p><br/><p>seemed to me, accustomed as I was to his every mood, that some</p><br/><p>new possibility had dawned suddenly upon him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was twenty past three when we reached our terminus, and after</p><br/><p>a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to Scotland</p><br/><p>Yard. Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him</p><br/><p>waiting to receive us—a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no</p><br/><p>means amiable expression. He was decidedly frigid in his manner</p><br/><p>to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had</p><br/><p>come.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I’ve heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes,” said he,</p><br/><p>tartly. “You are ready enough to use all the information that the</p><br/><p>police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the</p><br/><p>case yourself and bring discredit on them.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “out of my last fifty-three cases</p><br/><p>my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all</p><br/><p>the credit in forty-nine. I don’t blame you for not knowing this,</p><br/><p>for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in</p><br/><p>your new duties you will work with me and not against me.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I’d be very glad of a hint or two,” said the detective, changing</p><br/><p>his manner. “I’ve certainly had no credit from the case so far.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What steps have you taken?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Tangey, the commissionnaire, has been shadowed. He left the</p><br/><p>Guards with a good character and we can find nothing against him.</p><br/><p>His wife is a bad lot, though. I fancy she knows more about this</p><br/><p>than appears.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Have you shadowed her?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We have set one of our women on to her. Mrs. Tangey drinks, and</p><br/><p>our woman has been with her twice when she was well on, but she</p><br/><p>could get nothing out of her.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I understand that they have had brokers in the house?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, but they were paid off.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Where did the money come from?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That was all right. His pension was due. They have not shown any</p><br/><p>sign of being in funds.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What explanation did she give of having answered the bell when</p><br/><p>Mr. Phelps rang for the coffee?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“She said that her husband was very tired and she wished to</p><br/><p>relieve him.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, certainly that would agree with his being found a little</p><br/><p>later asleep in his chair. There is nothing against them then but</p><br/><p>the woman’s character. Did you ask her why she hurried away that</p><br/><p>night? Her haste attracted the attention of the police</p><br/><p>constable.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“She was later than usual and wanted to get home.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Did you point out to her that you and Mr. Phelps, who started at</p><br/><p>least twenty minutes after her, got home before her?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“She explains that by the difference between a ‘bus and a</p><br/><p>hansom.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Did she make it clear why, on reaching her house, she ran into</p><br/><p>the back kitchen?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Because she had the money there with which to pay off the</p><br/><p>brokers.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“She has at least an answer for everything. Did you ask her</p><br/><p>whether in leaving she met any one or saw any one loitering about</p><br/><p>Charles Street?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“She saw no one but the constable.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, you seem to have cross-examined her pretty thoroughly.</p><br/><p>What else have you done?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The clerk Gorot has been shadowed all these nine weeks, but</p><br/><p>without result. We can show nothing against him.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Anything else?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, we have nothing else to go upon—no evidence of any kind.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Have you formed a theory about how that bell rang?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, I must confess that it beats me. It was a cool hand,</p><br/><p>whoever it was, to go and give the alarm like that.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, it was a queer thing to do. Many thanks to you for what you</p><br/><p>have told me. If I can put the man into your hands you shall hear</p><br/><p>from me. Come along, Watson.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Where are we going to now?” I asked, as we left the office.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We are now going to interview Lord Holdhurst, the cabinet</p><br/><p>minister and future premier of England.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>We were fortunate in finding that Lord Holdhurst was still in his</p><br/><p>chambers in Downing Street, and on Holmes sending in his card we</p><br/><p>were instantly shown up. The statesman received us with that</p><br/><p>old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable, and seated us</p><br/><p>on the two luxuriant lounges on either side of the fireplace.</p><br/><p>Standing on the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his</p><br/><p>sharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair prematurely</p><br/><p>tinged with grey, he seemed to represent that not too common</p><br/><p>type, a nobleman who is in truth noble.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your name is very familiar to me, Mr. Holmes,” said he, smiling.</p><br/><p>“And, of course, I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of</p><br/><p>your visit. There has only been one occurrence in these offices</p><br/><p>which could call for your attention. In whose interest are you</p><br/><p>acting, may I ask?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“In that of Mr. Percy Phelps,” answered Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, my unfortunate nephew! You can understand that our kinship</p><br/><p>makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way. I</p><br/><p>fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon</p><br/><p>his career.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But if the document is found?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, that, of course, would be different.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I had one or two questions which I wished to ask you, Lord</p><br/><p>Holdhurst.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I shall be happy to give you any information in my power.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the</p><br/><p>copying of the document?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It was.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then you could hardly have been overheard?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is out of the question.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Did you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to</p><br/><p>give any one the treaty to be copied?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Never.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You are certain of that?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Absolutely.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, since you never said so, and Mr. Phelps never said so, and</p><br/><p>nobody else knew anything of the matter, then the thief’s</p><br/><p>presence in the room was purely accidental. He saw his chance and</p><br/><p>he took it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The statesman smiled. “You take me out of my province there,”</p><br/><p>said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes considered for a moment. “There is another very important</p><br/><p>point which I wish to discuss with you,” said he. “You feared, as</p><br/><p>I understand, that very grave results might follow from the</p><br/><p>details of this treaty becoming known.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>A shadow passed over the expressive face of the statesman. “Very</p><br/><p>grave results indeed.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And have they occurred?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Not yet.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“If the treaty had reached, let us say, the French or Russian</p><br/><p>Foreign Office, you would expect to hear of it?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I should,” said Lord Holdhurst, with a wry face.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, then, and nothing has been</p><br/><p>heard, it is not unfair to suppose that for some reason the</p><br/><p>treaty has not reached them.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Lord Holdhurst shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We can hardly suppose, Mr. Holmes, that the thief took the</p><br/><p>treaty in order to frame it and hang it up.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Perhaps he is waiting for a better price.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“If he waits a little longer he will get no price at all. The</p><br/><p>treaty will cease to be secret in a few months.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is most important,” said Holmes. “Of course, it is a</p><br/><p>possible supposition that the thief has had a sudden illness—”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“An attack of brain-fever, for example?” asked the statesman,</p><br/><p>flashing a swift glance at him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I did not say so,” said Holmes, imperturbably. “And now, Lord</p><br/><p>Holdhurst, we have already taken up too much of your valuable</p><br/><p>time, and we shall wish you good-day.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Every success to your investigation, be the criminal who it</p><br/><p>may,” answered the nobleman, as he bowed us out the door.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He’s a fine fellow,” said Holmes, as we came out into Whitehall.</p><br/><p>“But he has a struggle to keep up his position. He is far from</p><br/><p>rich and has many calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots</p><br/><p>had been resoled. Now, Watson, I won’t detain you from your</p><br/><p>legitimate work any longer. I shall do nothing more to-day,</p><br/><p>unless I have an answer to my cab advertisement. But I should be</p><br/><p>extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to Woking</p><br/><p>to-morrow, by the same train which we took yesterday.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I met him accordingly next morning and we travelled down to</p><br/><p>Woking together. He had had no answer to his advertisement, he</p><br/><p>said, and no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. He had,</p><br/><p>when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a</p><br/><p>red Indian, and I could not gather from his appearance whether he</p><br/><p>was satisfied or not with the position of the case. His</p><br/><p>conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of</p><br/><p>measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the</p><br/><p>French savant.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>We found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse,</p><br/><p>but looking considerably better than before. He rose from the</p><br/><p>sofa and greeted us without difficulty when we entered.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Any news?” he asked, eagerly.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My report, as I expected, is a negative one,” said Holmes. “I</p><br/><p>have seen Forbes, and I have seen your uncle, and I have set one</p><br/><p>or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may lead to something.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You have not lost heart, then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“By no means.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“God bless you for saying that!” cried Miss Harrison. “If we keep</p><br/><p>our courage and our patience the truth must come out.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We have more to tell you than you have for us,” said Phelps,</p><br/><p>reseating himself upon the couch.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I hoped you might have something.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, we have had an adventure during the night, and one which</p><br/><p>might have proved to be a serious one.” His expression grew very</p><br/><p>grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear sprang up</p><br/><p>in his eyes. “Do you know,” said he, “that I begin to believe</p><br/><p>that I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy,</p><br/><p>and that my life is aimed at as well as my honour?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah!” cried Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It sounds incredible, for I have not, as far as I know, an enemy</p><br/><p>in the world. Yet from last night’s experience I can come to no</p><br/><p>other conclusion.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Pray let me hear it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You must know that last night was the very first night that I</p><br/><p>have ever slept without a nurse in the room. I was so much better</p><br/><p>that I thought I could dispense with one. I had a night-light</p><br/><p>burning, however. Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into</p><br/><p>a light sleep when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It</p><br/><p>was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a</p><br/><p>plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under the</p><br/><p>impression that it must come from that cause. Then it grew</p><br/><p>louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic</p><br/><p>snick. I sat up in amazement. There could be no doubt what the</p><br/><p>sounds were now. The first ones had been caused by some one</p><br/><p>forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and</p><br/><p>the second by the catch being pressed back.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person</p><br/><p>were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me. Then I</p><br/><p>heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. I</p><br/><p>could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to</p><br/><p>be. I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. A man was</p><br/><p>crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was</p><br/><p>gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which</p><br/><p>came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure</p><br/><p>of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to</p><br/><p>me like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he</p><br/><p>turned to run.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“This is most interesting,” said Holmes. “Pray what did you do</p><br/><p>then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I should have followed him through the open window if I had been</p><br/><p>stronger. As it was, I rang the bell and roused the house. It</p><br/><p>took me some little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen and</p><br/><p>the servants all sleep upstairs. I shouted, however, and that</p><br/><p>brought Joseph down, and he roused the others. Joseph and the</p><br/><p>groom found marks on the bed outside the window, but the weather</p><br/><p>has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the</p><br/><p>trail across the grass. There’s a place, however, on the wooden</p><br/><p>fence which skirts the road which shows signs, they tell me, as</p><br/><p>if some one had got over, and had snapped the top of the rail in</p><br/><p>doing so. I have said nothing to the local police yet, for I</p><br/><p>thought I had best have your opinion first.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>This tale of our client’s appeared to have an extraordinary</p><br/><p>effect upon Sherlock Holmes. He rose from his chair and paced</p><br/><p>about the room in uncontrollable excitement.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Misfortunes never come single,” said Phelps, smiling, though it</p><br/><p>was evident that his adventure had somewhat shaken him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You have certainly had your share,” said Holmes. “Do you think</p><br/><p>you could walk round the house with me?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. Joseph will come,</p><br/><p>too.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And I also,” said Miss Harrison.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I am afraid not,” said Holmes, shaking his head. “I think I must</p><br/><p>ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. Her</p><br/><p>brother, however, had joined us and we set off all four together.</p><br/><p>We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young</p><br/><p>diplomatist’s window. There were, as he had said, marks upon the</p><br/><p>bed, but they were hopelessly blurred and vague. Holmes stopped</p><br/><p>over them for an instant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I don’t think any one could make much of this,” said he. “Let us</p><br/><p>go round the house and see why this particular room was chosen by</p><br/><p>the burglar. I should have thought those larger windows of the</p><br/><p>drawing-room and dining-room would have had more attractions for</p><br/><p>him.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“They are more visible from the road,” suggested Mr. Joseph</p><br/><p>Harrison.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, yes, of course. There is a door here which he might have</p><br/><p>attempted. What is it for?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is the side entrance for trades-people. Of course it is</p><br/><p>locked at night.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Have you ever had an alarm like this before?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Never,” said our client.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract</p><br/><p>burglars?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Nothing of value.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes strolled round the house with his hands in his pockets and</p><br/><p>a negligent air which was unusual with him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“By the way,” said he to Joseph Harrison, “you found some place,</p><br/><p>I understand, where the fellow scaled the fence. Let us have a</p><br/><p>look at that!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The plump young man led us to a spot where the top of one of the</p><br/><p>wooden rails had been cracked. A small fragment of the wood was</p><br/><p>hanging down. Holmes pulled it off and examined it critically.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Do you think that was done last night? It looks rather old, does</p><br/><p>it not?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, possibly so.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There are no marks of any one jumping down upon the other side.</p><br/><p>No, I fancy we shall get no help here. Let us go back to the</p><br/><p>bedroom and talk the matter over.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Percy Phelps was walking very slowly, leaning upon the arm of his</p><br/><p>future brother-in-law. Holmes walked swiftly across the lawn, and</p><br/><p>we were at the open window of the bedroom long before the others</p><br/><p>came up.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Miss Harrison,” said Holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity</p><br/><p>of manner, “you must stay where you are all day. Let nothing</p><br/><p>prevent you from staying where you are all day. It is of the</p><br/><p>utmost importance.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Certainly, if you wish it, Mr. Holmes,” said the girl in</p><br/><p>astonishment.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“When you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and</p><br/><p>keep the key. Promise to do this.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But Percy?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He will come to London with us.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And am I to remain here?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is for his sake. You can serve him. Quick! Promise!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>She gave a quick nod of assent just as the other two came up.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Why do you sit moping there, Annie?” cried her brother. “Come</p><br/><p>out into the sunshine!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, thank you, Joseph. I have a slight headache and this room is</p><br/><p>deliciously cool and soothing.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What do you propose now, Mr. Holmes?” asked our client.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight</p><br/><p>of our main inquiry. It would be a very great help to me if you</p><br/><p>would come up to London with us.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“At once?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, as soon as you conveniently can. Say in an hour.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I feel quite strong enough, if I can really be of any help.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The greatest possible.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Perhaps you would like me to stay there to-night?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I was just going to propose it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then, if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will</p><br/><p>find the bird flown. We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and</p><br/><p>you must tell us exactly what you would like done. Perhaps you</p><br/><p>would prefer that Joseph came with us so as to look after me?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man, you know, and he’ll</p><br/><p>look after you. We’ll have our lunch here, if you will permit us,</p><br/><p>and then we shall all three set off for town together.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss Harrison excused</p><br/><p>herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with Holmes’s</p><br/><p>suggestion. What the object of my friend’s manœuvres was I could</p><br/><p>not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from Phelps,</p><br/><p>who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of</p><br/><p>action, lunched with us in the dining-room. Holmes had a still</p><br/><p>more startling surprise for us, however, for, after accompanying</p><br/><p>us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly</p><br/><p>announced that he had no intention of leaving Woking.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There are one or two small points which I should desire to clear</p><br/><p>up before I go,” said he. “Your absence, Mr. Phelps, will in some</p><br/><p>ways rather assist me. Watson, when you reach London you would</p><br/><p>oblige me by driving at once to Baker Street with our friend</p><br/><p>here, and remaining with him until I see you again. It is</p><br/><p>fortunate that you are old schoolfellows, as you must have much</p><br/><p>to talk over. Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and</p><br/><p>I will be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train</p><br/><p>which will take me into Waterloo at eight.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But how about our investigation in London?” asked Phelps,</p><br/><p>ruefully.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We can do that to-morrow. I think that just at present I can be</p><br/><p>of more immediate use here.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope to be back</p><br/><p>to-morrow night,” cried Phelps, as we began to move from the</p><br/><p>platform.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,” answered Holmes, and</p><br/><p>waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but neither of us</p><br/><p>could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last</p><br/><p>night, if a burglar it was. For myself, I don’t believe it was an</p><br/><p>ordinary thief.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What is your own idea, then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Upon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but</p><br/><p>I believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around</p><br/><p>me, and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life</p><br/><p>is aimed at by the conspirators. It sounds high-flown and absurd,</p><br/><p>but consider the facts! Why should a thief try to break in at a</p><br/><p>bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and</p><br/><p>why should he come with a long knife in his hand?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You are sure it was not a house-breaker’s jimmy?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, no, it was a knife. I saw the flash of the blade quite</p><br/><p>distinctly.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, that is the question.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, if Holmes takes the same view, that would account for his</p><br/><p>action, would it not? Presuming that your theory is correct, if</p><br/><p>he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night</p><br/><p>he will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval</p><br/><p>treaty. It is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies, one of</p><br/><p>whom robs you, while the other threatens your life.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But Holmes said that he was not going to Briarbrae.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have known him for some time,” said I, “but I never knew him</p><br/><p>do anything yet without a very good reason,” and with that our</p><br/><p>conversation drifted off on to other topics.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>But it was a weary day for me. Phelps was still weak after his</p><br/><p>long illness, and his misfortune made him querulous and nervous.</p><br/><p>In vain I endeavoured to interest him in Afghanistan, in India,</p><br/><p>in social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of</p><br/><p>the groove. He would always come back to his lost treaty,</p><br/><p>wondering, guessing, speculating, as to what Holmes was doing,</p><br/><p>what steps Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in</p><br/><p>the morning. As the evening wore on his excitement became quite</p><br/><p>painful.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You have implicit faith in Holmes?” he asked.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have seen him do some remarkable things.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, yes; I have known him solve questions which presented fewer</p><br/><p>clues than yours.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But not where such large interests are at stake?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I don’t know that. To my certain knowledge he has acted on</p><br/><p>behalf of three of the reigning houses of Europe in very vital</p><br/><p>matters.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But you know him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow</p><br/><p>that I never quite know what to make of him. Do you think he is</p><br/><p>hopeful? Do you think he expects to make a success of it?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He has said nothing.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is a bad sign.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“On the contrary, I have noticed that when he is off the trail he</p><br/><p>generally says so. It is when he is on a scent and is not quite</p><br/><p>absolutely sure yet that it is the right one that he is most</p><br/><p>taciturn. Now, my dear fellow, we can’t help matters by making</p><br/><p>ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed</p><br/><p>and so be fresh for whatever may await us to-morrow.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I was able at last to persuade my companion to take my advice,</p><br/><p>though I knew from his excited manner that there was not much</p><br/><p>hope of sleep for him. Indeed, his mood was infectious, for I lay</p><br/><p>tossing half the night myself, brooding over this strange</p><br/><p>problem, and inventing a hundred theories, each of which was more</p><br/><p>impossible than the last. Why had Holmes remained at Woking? Why</p><br/><p>had he asked Miss Harrison to remain in the sick-room all day?</p><br/><p>Why had he been so careful not to inform the people at Briarbrae</p><br/><p>that he intended to remain near them? I cudgelled my brains until</p><br/><p>I fell asleep in the endeavour to find some explanation which</p><br/><p>would cover all these facts.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was seven o’clock when I awoke, and I set off at once for</p><br/><p>Phelps’s room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless</p><br/><p>night. His first question was whether Holmes had arrived yet.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He’ll be here when he promised,” said I, “and not an instant</p><br/><p>sooner or later.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>And my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed</p><br/><p>up to the door and our friend got out of it. Standing in the</p><br/><p>window we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and</p><br/><p>that his face was very grim and pale. He entered the house, but</p><br/><p>it was some little time before he came upstairs.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He looks like a beaten man,” cried Phelps.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I was forced to confess that he was right. “After all,” said I,</p><br/><p>“the clue of the matter lies probably here in town.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Phelps gave a groan.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I don’t know how it is,” said he, “but I had hoped for so much</p><br/><p>from his return. But surely his hand was not tied up like that</p><br/><p>yesterday. What can be the matter?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You are not wounded, Holmes?” I asked, as my friend entered the</p><br/><p>room.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Tut, it is only a scratch through my own clumsiness,” he</p><br/><p>answered, nodding his good-mornings to us. “This case of yours,</p><br/><p>Mr. Phelps, is certainly one of the darkest which I have ever</p><br/><p>investigated.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I feared that you would find it beyond you.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It has been a most remarkable experience.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That bandage tells of adventures,” said I. “Won’t you tell us</p><br/><p>what has happened?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“After breakfast, my dear Watson. Remember that I have breathed</p><br/><p>thirty miles of Surrey air this morning. I suppose that there has</p><br/><p>been no answer from my cabman advertisement? Well, well, we</p><br/><p>cannot expect to score every time.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The table was all laid, and just as I was about to ring Mrs.</p><br/><p>Hudson entered with the tea and coffee. A few minutes later she</p><br/><p>brought in three covers, and we all drew up to the table, Holmes</p><br/><p>ravenous, I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of</p><br/><p>depression.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Mrs. Hudson has risen to the occasion,” said Holmes, uncovering</p><br/><p>a dish of curried chicken. “Her cuisine is a little limited, but</p><br/><p>she has as good an idea of breakfast as a Scotch-woman. What have</p><br/><p>you here, Watson?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ham and eggs,” I answered.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Good! What are you going to take, Mr. Phelps—curried fowl or</p><br/><p>eggs, or will you help yourself?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you. I can eat nothing,” said Phelps.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh, come! Try the dish before you.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you, I would really rather not.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, then,” said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle, “I suppose</p><br/><p>that you have no objection to helping me?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream,</p><br/><p>and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon</p><br/><p>which he looked. Across the centre of it was lying a little</p><br/><p>cylinder of blue-grey paper. He caught it up, devoured it with</p><br/><p>his eyes, and then danced madly about the room, pressing it to</p><br/><p>his bosom and shrieking out in his delight. Then he fell back</p><br/><p>into an armchair so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that</p><br/><p>we had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There! there!” said Holmes, soothing, patting him upon the</p><br/><p>shoulder. “It was too bad to spring it on you like this, but</p><br/><p>Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the</p><br/><p>dramatic.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Phelps seized his hand and kissed it. “God bless you!” he cried.</p><br/><p>“You have saved my honour.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, my own was at stake, you know,” said Holmes. “I assure you</p><br/><p>it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you</p><br/><p>to blunder over a commission.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Phelps thrust away the precious document into the innermost</p><br/><p>pocket of his coat.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast any further,</p><br/><p>and yet I am dying to know how you got it and where it was.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of coffee, and turned his</p><br/><p>attention to the ham and eggs. Then he rose, lit his pipe, and</p><br/><p>settled himself down into his chair.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I’ll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it</p><br/><p>afterwards,” said he. “After leaving you at the station I went</p><br/><p>for a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a</p><br/><p>pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an</p><br/><p>inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a</p><br/><p>paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There I remained until evening,</p><br/><p>when I set off for Woking again, and found myself in the</p><br/><p>high-road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, I waited until the road was clear—it is never a very</p><br/><p>frequented one at any time, I fancy—and then I clambered over the</p><br/><p>fence into the grounds.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Surely the gate was open!” ejaculated Phelps.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, but I have a peculiar taste in these matters. I chose the</p><br/><p>place where the three fir-trees stand, and behind their screen I</p><br/><p>got over without the least chance of any one in the house being</p><br/><p>able to see me. I crouched down among the bushes on the other</p><br/><p>side, and crawled from one to the other—witness the disreputable</p><br/><p>state of my trouser knees—until I had reached the clump of</p><br/><p>rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom window. There I</p><br/><p>squatted down and awaited developments.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss</p><br/><p>Harrison sitting there reading by the table. It was quarter-past</p><br/><p>ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had</p><br/><p>turned the key in the lock.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The key!” ejaculated Phelps.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes; I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on</p><br/><p>the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She</p><br/><p>carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and</p><br/><p>certainly without her co-operation you would not have that paper</p><br/><p>in your coat-pocket. She departed then and the lights went out,</p><br/><p>and I was left squatting in the rhododendron-bush.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. Of</p><br/><p>course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman</p><br/><p>feels when he lies beside the water-course and waits for the big</p><br/><p>game. It was very long, though—almost as long, Watson, as when</p><br/><p>you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the</p><br/><p>little problem of the Speckled Band. There was a church-clock</p><br/><p>down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than</p><br/><p>once that it had stopped. At last however about two in the</p><br/><p>morning, I suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed</p><br/><p>back and the creaking of a key. A moment later the servants’ door</p><br/><p>was opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into the</p><br/><p>moonlight.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Joseph!” ejaculated Phelps.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He was bare-headed, but he had a black coat thrown over his</p><br/><p>shoulder so that he could conceal his face in an instant if there</p><br/><p>were any alarm. He walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall,</p><br/><p>and when he reached the window he worked a long-bladed knife</p><br/><p>through the sash and pushed back the catch. Then he flung open</p><br/><p>the window, and putting his knife through the crack in the</p><br/><p>shutters, he thrust the bar up and swung them open.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“From where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room</p><br/><p>and of every one of his movements. He lit the two candles which</p><br/><p>stood upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back</p><br/><p>the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door.</p><br/><p>Presently he stopped and picked out a square piece of board, such</p><br/><p>as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the</p><br/><p>gas-pipes. This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T joint</p><br/><p>which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath.</p><br/><p>Out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper,</p><br/><p>pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the</p><br/><p>candles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood waiting for</p><br/><p>him outside the window.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, he has rather more viciousness than I gave him credit for,</p><br/><p>has Master Joseph. He flew at me with his knife, and I had to</p><br/><p>grasp him twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before I had</p><br/><p>the upper hand of him. He looked murder out of the only eye he</p><br/><p>could see with when we had finished, but he listened to reason</p><br/><p>and gave up the papers. Having got them I let my man go, but I</p><br/><p>wired full particulars to Forbes this morning. If he is quick</p><br/><p>enough to catch his bird, well and good. But if, as I shrewdly</p><br/><p>suspect, he finds the nest empty before he gets there, why, all</p><br/><p>the better for the government. I fancy that Lord Holdhurst for</p><br/><p>one, and Mr. Percy Phelps for another, would very much rather</p><br/><p>that the affair never got as far as a police-court.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My God!” gasped our client. “Do you tell me that during these</p><br/><p>long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very</p><br/><p>room with me all the time?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“So it was.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And Joseph! Joseph a villain and a thief!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Hum! I am afraid Joseph’s character is a rather deeper and more</p><br/><p>dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance. From what</p><br/><p>I have heard from him this morning, I gather that he has lost</p><br/><p>heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do</p><br/><p>anything on earth to better his fortunes. Being an absolutely</p><br/><p>selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow</p><br/><p>either his sister’s happiness or your reputation to hold his</p><br/><p>hand.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Percy Phelps sank back in his chair. “My head whirls,” said he.</p><br/><p>“Your words have dazed me.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The principal difficulty in your case,” remarked Holmes, in his</p><br/><p>didactic fashion, “lay in the fact of there being too much</p><br/><p>evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was</p><br/><p>irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to</p><br/><p>pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece</p><br/><p>them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very</p><br/><p>remarkable chain of events. I had already begun to suspect</p><br/><p>Joseph, from the fact that you had intended to travel home with</p><br/><p>him that night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing</p><br/><p>that he should call for you, knowing the Foreign Office well,</p><br/><p>upon his way. When I heard that some one had been so anxious to</p><br/><p>get into the bedroom, in which no one but Joseph could have</p><br/><p>concealed anything—you told us in your narrative how you had</p><br/><p>turned Joseph out when you arrived with the doctor—my suspicions</p><br/><p>all changed to certainties, especially as the attempt was made on</p><br/><p>the first night upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the</p><br/><p>intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“How blind I have been!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The facts of the case, as far as I have worked them out, are</p><br/><p>these: this Joseph Harrison entered the office through the</p><br/><p>Charles Street door, and knowing his way he walked straight into</p><br/><p>your room the instant after you left it. Finding no one there he</p><br/><p>promptly rang the bell, and at the instant that he did so his</p><br/><p>eyes caught the paper upon the table. A glance showed him that</p><br/><p>chance had put in his way a State document of immense value, and</p><br/><p>in an instant he had thrust it into his pocket and was gone. A</p><br/><p>few minutes elapsed, as you remember, before the sleepy</p><br/><p>commissionnaire drew your attention to the bell, and those were</p><br/><p>just enough to give the thief time to make his escape.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He made his way to Woking by the first train, and having</p><br/><p>examined his booty and assured himself that it really was of</p><br/><p>immense value, he had concealed it in what he thought was a very</p><br/><p>safe place, with the intention of taking it out again in a day or</p><br/><p>two, and carrying it to the French embassy, or wherever he</p><br/><p>thought that a long price was to be had. Then came your sudden</p><br/><p>return. He, without a moment’s warning, was bundled out of his</p><br/><p>room, and from that time onward there were always at least two of</p><br/><p>you there to prevent him from regaining his treasure. The</p><br/><p>situation to him must have been a maddening one. But at last he</p><br/><p>thought he saw his chance. He tried to steal in, but was baffled</p><br/><p>by your wakefulness. You remember that you did not take your</p><br/><p>usual draught that night.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I remember.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I fancy that he had taken steps to make that draught</p><br/><p>efficacious, and that he quite relied upon your being</p><br/><p>unconscious. Of course, I understood that he would repeat the</p><br/><p>attempt whenever it could be done with safety. Your leaving the</p><br/><p>room gave him the chance he wanted. I kept Miss Harrison in it</p><br/><p>all day so that he might not anticipate us. Then, having given</p><br/><p>him the idea that the coast was clear, I kept guard as I have</p><br/><p>described. I already knew that the papers were probably in the</p><br/><p>room, but I had no desire to rip up all the planking and skirting</p><br/><p>in search of them. I let him take them, therefore, from the</p><br/><p>hiding-place, and so saved myself an infinity of trouble. Is</p><br/><p>there any other point which I can make clear?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Why did he try the window on the first occasion,” I asked, “when</p><br/><p>he might have entered by the door?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“In reaching the door he would have to pass seven bedrooms. On</p><br/><p>the other hand, he could get out on to the lawn with ease.</p><br/><p>Anything else?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You do not think,” asked Phelps, “that he had any murderous</p><br/><p>intention? The knife was only meant as a tool.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It may be so,” answered Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “I can</p><br/><p>only say for certain that Mr. Joseph Harrison is a gentleman to</p><br/><p>whose mercy I should be extremely unwilling to trust.”</p><br/>
