             <p>THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND</p><br/><p></p><br/><p></p><br/><p>On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have</p><br/><p>during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock</p><br/><p>Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,</p><br/><p>but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his</p><br/><p>art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself</p><br/><p>with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even</p><br/><p>the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any</p><br/><p>which presented more singular features than that which was associated</p><br/><p>with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The</p><br/><p>events in question occurred in the early days of my association with</p><br/><p>Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It</p><br/><p>is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a</p><br/><p>promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been</p><br/><p>freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom</p><br/><p>the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now</p><br/><p>come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are wide-spread</p><br/><p>rumors as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the</p><br/><p>matter even more terrible than the truth.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find</p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was</p><br/><p>a late riser as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel-piece showed</p><br/><p>me that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked up at him in some</p><br/><p>surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself</p><br/><p>regular in my habits.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot</p><br/><p>this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,</p><br/><p>and I on you.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What is it, then—a fire?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable</p><br/><p>state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in</p><br/><p>the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis</p><br/><p>at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their</p><br/><p>beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to</p><br/><p>communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am</p><br/><p>sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I</p><br/><p>should call you and give you the chance.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional</p><br/><p>investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as</p><br/><p>intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he</p><br/><p>unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on</p><br/><p>my clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down</p><br/><p>to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who</p><br/><p>had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes, cheerily. “My name is Sherlock</p><br/><p>Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before</p><br/><p>whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see</p><br/><p>that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up</p><br/><p>to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that</p><br/><p>you are shivering.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman, in a low voice,</p><br/><p>changing her seat as requested.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What, then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she</p><br/><p>spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of</p><br/><p>agitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes,</p><br/><p>like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of</p><br/><p>a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature gray, and her</p><br/><p>expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one</p><br/><p>of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You must not fear,” said he, soothingly, bending forward and patting</p><br/><p>her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You</p><br/><p>have come in by train this morning, I see.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You know me, then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of</p><br/><p>your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good</p><br/><p>drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The lady gave a violent start, and stared in bewilderment at my</p><br/><p>companion.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm</p><br/><p>of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The</p><br/><p>marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which</p><br/><p>throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand</p><br/><p>side of the driver.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I</p><br/><p>started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and</p><br/><p>came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no</p><br/><p>longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,</p><br/><p>save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little</p><br/><p>aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.</p><br/><p>Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from</p><br/><p>her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could</p><br/><p>help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense</p><br/><p>darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward</p><br/><p>you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,</p><br/><p>with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not</p><br/><p>find me ungrateful.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes turned to his desk, and unlocking it, drew out a small</p><br/><p>case-book, which he consulted.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with</p><br/><p>an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,</p><br/><p>madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as</p><br/><p>I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own</p><br/><p>reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put</p><br/><p>to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay</p><br/><p>before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the</p><br/><p>matter.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies</p><br/><p>in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so</p><br/><p>entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that</p><br/><p>even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and</p><br/><p>advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a</p><br/><p>nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing</p><br/><p>answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can</p><br/><p>see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may</p><br/><p>advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I am all attention, madam.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my step-father, who is</p><br/><p>the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the</p><br/><p>Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the</p><br/><p>estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and</p><br/><p>Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive</p><br/><p>heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family</p><br/><p>ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the</p><br/><p>Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the</p><br/><p>two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy</p><br/><p>mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living</p><br/><p>the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my</p><br/><p>step-father, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,</p><br/><p>obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a</p><br/><p>medical degree, and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional</p><br/><p>skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.</p><br/><p>In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been</p><br/><p>perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death, and</p><br/><p>narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long</p><br/><p>term of imprisonment, and afterwards returned to England a morose and</p><br/><p>disappointed man.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the</p><br/><p>young widow of Major-general Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister</p><br/><p>Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of</p><br/><p>my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less</p><br/><p>than £1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely</p><br/><p>while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum</p><br/><p>should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly</p><br/><p>after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years</p><br/><p>ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his</p><br/><p>attempts to establish himself in practice in London, and took us to</p><br/><p>live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money</p><br/><p>which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed</p><br/><p>to be no obstacle to our happiness.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But a terrible change came over our step-father about this time.</p><br/><p>Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who</p><br/><p>had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in</p><br/><p>the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came</p><br/><p>out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his</p><br/><p>path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in</p><br/><p>the men of the family, and in my step-father’s case it had, I believe,</p><br/><p>been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of</p><br/><p>disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,</p><br/><p>until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks</p><br/><p>would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and</p><br/><p>absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,</p><br/><p>and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather</p><br/><p>together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no</p><br/><p>friends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these</p><br/><p>vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land</p><br/><p>which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the</p><br/><p>hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for</p><br/><p>weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent</p><br/><p>over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and</p><br/><p>a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds, and are feared by the</p><br/><p>villagers almost as much as their master.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no</p><br/><p>great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a</p><br/><p>long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the</p><br/><p>time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even</p><br/><p>as mine has.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your sister is dead, then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to</p><br/><p>speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have</p><br/><p>described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and</p><br/><p>position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss</p><br/><p>Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally</p><br/><p>allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at</p><br/><p>Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines,</p><br/><p>to whom she became engaged. My step-father learned of the engagement</p><br/><p>when my sister returned, and offered no objection to the marriage; but</p><br/><p>within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the</p><br/><p>terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed</p><br/><p>and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and</p><br/><p>glanced across at his visitor.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is</p><br/><p>seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very</p><br/><p>old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are</p><br/><p>on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of</p><br/><p>the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second</p><br/><p>my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between</p><br/><p>them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself</p><br/><p>plain?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Perfectly so.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal</p><br/><p>night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he</p><br/><p>had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of</p><br/><p>the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left</p><br/><p>her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,</p><br/><p>chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to</p><br/><p>leave me but she paused at the door and looked back.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard any one whistle in</p><br/><p>the dead of the night?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Never,’ said I.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your</p><br/><p>sleep?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Certainly not. But why?’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in</p><br/><p>the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it</p><br/><p>has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the</p><br/><p>next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you</p><br/><p>whether you had heard it.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did</p><br/><p>not hear it also.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at</p><br/><p>me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the</p><br/><p>lock.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in</p><br/><p>at night?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Always.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And why?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a</p><br/><p>baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune</p><br/><p>impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you</p><br/><p>know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely</p><br/><p>allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain</p><br/><p>was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the</p><br/><p>hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified</p><br/><p>woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,</p><br/><p>wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my</p><br/><p>door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a</p><br/><p>few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.</p><br/><p>As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved</p><br/><p>slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing</p><br/><p>what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I</p><br/><p>saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her</p><br/><p>hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that</p><br/><p>of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that</p><br/><p>moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She</p><br/><p>writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully</p><br/><p>convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognized me, but as I</p><br/><p>bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never</p><br/><p>forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There</p><br/><p>was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with</p><br/><p>her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s room, but a</p><br/><p>fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling</p><br/><p>loudly for my step-father, and I met him hastening from his room in his</p><br/><p>dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,</p><br/><p>and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid</p><br/><p>from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and</p><br/><p>died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful</p><br/><p>end of my beloved sister.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“One moment,” said Holmes; “are you sure about this whistle and</p><br/><p>metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my</p><br/><p>strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale</p><br/><p>and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Was your sister dressed?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the</p><br/><p>charred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the</p><br/><p>alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the</p><br/><p>coroner come to?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct</p><br/><p>had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any</p><br/><p>satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had</p><br/><p>been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by</p><br/><p>old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every</p><br/><p>night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite</p><br/><p>solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with</p><br/><p>the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large</p><br/><p>staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when</p><br/><p>she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“How about poison?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though</p><br/><p>what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Were there gypsies in the plantation at the time?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled</p><br/><p>band?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,</p><br/><p>sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to</p><br/><p>these very gypsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted</p><br/><p>handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have</p><br/><p>suggested the strange adjective which she used.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately</p><br/><p>lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have</p><br/><p>known for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage.</p><br/><p>His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage,</p><br/><p>of Crane Water, near Reading. My step-father has offered no opposition</p><br/><p>to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two</p><br/><p>days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building,</p><br/><p>and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into</p><br/><p>the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in</p><br/><p>which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night,</p><br/><p>as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in</p><br/><p>the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of</p><br/><p>her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be</p><br/><p>seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I</p><br/><p>dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart</p><br/><p>at the ‘Crown Inn,’ which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from</p><br/><p>whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you</p><br/><p>and asking your advice.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, all.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your step-father.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Why, what do you mean?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the</p><br/><p>hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the</p><br/><p>marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a</p><br/><p>hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his</p><br/><p>hands and stared into the crackling fire.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“This is a very deep business,” he said, at last. “There are a thousand</p><br/><p>details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course</p><br/><p>of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to</p><br/><p>Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms</p><br/><p>without the knowledge of your step-father?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most</p><br/><p>important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and</p><br/><p>that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a house-keeper</p><br/><p>now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the</p><br/><p>way.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“By no means.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in</p><br/><p>town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there</p><br/><p>in time for your coming.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small</p><br/><p>business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided</p><br/><p>my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this</p><br/><p>afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided</p><br/><p>from the room.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,</p><br/><p>leaning back in his chair.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Dark enough and sinister enough.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are</p><br/><p>sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her</p><br/><p>sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious</p><br/><p>end.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very</p><br/><p>peculiar words of the dying woman?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I cannot think.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a</p><br/><p>band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the</p><br/><p>fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an</p><br/><p>interest in preventing his step-daughter’s marriage, the dying allusion</p><br/><p>to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a</p><br/><p>metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars</p><br/><p>which secured the shutters falling back into their place, I think that</p><br/><p>there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along</p><br/><p>those lines.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But what, then, did the gypsies do?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I cannot imagine.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I see many objections to any such theory.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to</p><br/><p>Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,</p><br/><p>or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our</p><br/><p>door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed</p><br/><p>himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the</p><br/><p>professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long</p><br/><p>frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in</p><br/><p>his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar</p><br/><p>of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to</p><br/><p>side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with</p><br/><p>the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the</p><br/><p>other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,</p><br/><p>fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird</p><br/><p>of prey.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion,</p><br/><p>quietly.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Indeed, doctor,” said Holmes, blandly. “Pray take a seat.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I will do nothing of the kind. My step-daughter has been here. I have</p><br/><p>traced her. What has she been saying to you?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man, furiously.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my</p><br/><p>companion, imperturbably.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step</p><br/><p>forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I</p><br/><p>have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>My friend smiled.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Holmes, the busybody!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>His smile broadened.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Holmes, the Scotland-yard Jack-in-office!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”</p><br/><p>said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided</p><br/><p>draught.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I will go when I have said my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my</p><br/><p>affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a</p><br/><p>dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,</p><br/><p>seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling</p><br/><p>the twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not</p><br/><p>quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my</p><br/><p>grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up</p><br/><p>the steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official</p><br/><p>detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,</p><br/><p>however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from</p><br/><p>her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson,</p><br/><p>we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’</p><br/><p>Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this</p><br/><p>matter.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>       *       *       *       *       *</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his</p><br/><p>excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over</p><br/><p>with notes and figures.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine</p><br/><p>its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices</p><br/><p>of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which</p><br/><p>at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £1100, is now,</p><br/><p>through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £750. Each</p><br/><p>daughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage. It is</p><br/><p>evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would</p><br/><p>have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to</p><br/><p>a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it</p><br/><p>has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the</p><br/><p>way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for</p><br/><p>dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting</p><br/><p>ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and</p><br/><p>drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your</p><br/><p>revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument</p><br/><p>with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a</p><br/><p>tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,</p><br/><p>where we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five</p><br/><p>miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with</p><br/><p>a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and</p><br/><p>way-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and</p><br/><p>the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at</p><br/><p>least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the</p><br/><p>spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion</p><br/><p>sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over</p><br/><p>his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest</p><br/><p>thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and</p><br/><p>pointed over the meadows.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Look there!” said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>A heavily-timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into</p><br/><p>a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out</p><br/><p>the gray gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Stoke Moran?” said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the</p><br/><p>driver.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we</p><br/><p>are going.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs</p><br/><p>some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll</p><br/><p>find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over</p><br/><p>the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his</p><br/><p>eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to</p><br/><p>Leatherhead.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I thought it as well,” said Holmes, as we climbed the stile, “that</p><br/><p>this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some</p><br/><p>definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.</p><br/><p>You see that we have been as good as our word.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face</p><br/><p>which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she</p><br/><p>cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly.</p><br/><p>Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back</p><br/><p>before evening.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said</p><br/><p>Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss</p><br/><p>Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“So it appears.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will</p><br/><p>he say when he returns?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is some one more</p><br/><p>cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him</p><br/><p>to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at</p><br/><p>Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us</p><br/><p>at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The building was of gray, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central</p><br/><p>portion, and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out</p><br/><p>on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken, and</p><br/><p>blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a</p><br/><p>picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but</p><br/><p>the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the</p><br/><p>windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that</p><br/><p>this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected</p><br/><p>against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but</p><br/><p>there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes</p><br/><p>walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep</p><br/><p>attention the outsides of the windows.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the</p><br/><p>centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to</p><br/><p>Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By-the-way, there does not</p><br/><p>seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my</p><br/><p>room.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing</p><br/><p>runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows</p><br/><p>in it, of course?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for any one to pass through.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable</p><br/><p>from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room</p><br/><p>and bar your shutters.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through</p><br/><p>the open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open,</p><br/><p>but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be</p><br/><p>passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but</p><br/><p>they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”</p><br/><p>said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; “my theory certainly</p><br/><p>presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they</p><br/><p>were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the</p><br/><p>matter.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the</p><br/><p>three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber,</p><br/><p>so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now</p><br/><p>sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a</p><br/><p>homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after</p><br/><p>the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood</p><br/><p>in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a</p><br/><p>dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,</p><br/><p>with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the</p><br/><p>room, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards</p><br/><p>round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so</p><br/><p>old and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of</p><br/><p>the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,</p><br/><p>while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in</p><br/><p>every detail of the apartment.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked, at last, pointing to</p><br/><p>a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually</p><br/><p>lying upon the pillow.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It goes to the house-keeper’s room.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It looks newer than the other things?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we</p><br/><p>wanted for ourselves.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You</p><br/><p>will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this</p><br/><p>floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand,</p><br/><p>and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks</p><br/><p>between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which</p><br/><p>the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed, and spent</p><br/><p>some time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the</p><br/><p>wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Won’t it ring?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You</p><br/><p>can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little</p><br/><p>opening for the ventilator is.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or</p><br/><p>two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a</p><br/><p>builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the</p><br/><p>same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy</p><br/><p>bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your</p><br/><p>permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the</p><br/><p>inner apartment.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his</p><br/><p>step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden</p><br/><p>shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-chair</p><br/><p>beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,</p><br/><p>and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.</p><br/><p>Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the</p><br/><p>keenest interest.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My step-father’s business papers.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No. What a strange idea!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on</p><br/><p>the top of it.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a</p><br/><p>saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I dare</p><br/><p>say. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted</p><br/><p>down in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the</p><br/><p>greatest attention.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his</p><br/><p>lens in his pocket. “Hello! Here is something interesting!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one</p><br/><p>corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied</p><br/><p>so as to make a loop of whip-cord.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What do you make of that, Watson?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world,</p><br/><p>and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of</p><br/><p>all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your</p><br/><p>permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it</p><br/><p>was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked</p><br/><p>several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself</p><br/><p>liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his</p><br/><p>reverie.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should</p><br/><p>absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I shall most certainly do so.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend</p><br/><p>upon your compliance.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I assure you that I am in your hands.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your</p><br/><p>room.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village</p><br/><p>inn over there?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, that is the ‘Crown.’”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Certainly.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,</p><br/><p>when your step-father comes back. Then when you hear him retire for</p><br/><p>the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp,</p><br/><p>put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with</p><br/><p>everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to</p><br/><p>occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage</p><br/><p>there for one night.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh yes, easily.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The rest you will leave in our hands.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But what will you do?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the</p><br/><p>cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said</p><br/><p>Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Perhaps I have.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then for pity’s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she</p><br/><p>died from some sudden fright.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>[Illustration: “‘GOOD-BYE, AND BE BRAVE’”]</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more</p><br/><p>tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you, for if Dr.</p><br/><p>Roylott returned and saw us, our journey would be in vain. Good-bye,</p><br/><p>and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest</p><br/><p>assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and</p><br/><p>sitting-room at the “Crown Inn.” They were on the upper floor, and</p><br/><p>from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the</p><br/><p>inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby</p><br/><p>Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure</p><br/><p>of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing</p><br/><p>the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s</p><br/><p>voice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.</p><br/><p>The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring</p><br/><p>up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes, as we sat together in the gathering</p><br/><p>darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There</p><br/><p>is a distinct element of danger.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Can I be of assistance?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Your presence might be invaluable.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Then I shall certainly come.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is very kind of you.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than</p><br/><p>was visible to me.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that</p><br/><p>you saw all that I did.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that</p><br/><p>could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You saw the ventilator, too?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have</p><br/><p>a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could</p><br/><p>hardly pass through.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke</p><br/><p>Moran.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My dear Holmes!”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Oh yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister</p><br/><p>could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once</p><br/><p>that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only</p><br/><p>be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s</p><br/><p>inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“But what harm can there be in that?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator</p><br/><p>is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does</p><br/><p>not that strike you?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I cannot as yet see any connection.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“No.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that</p><br/><p>before?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I cannot say that I have.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same</p><br/><p>relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—for so we may call</p><br/><p>it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are</p><br/><p>only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong, he is</p><br/><p>the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and</p><br/><p>Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes</p><br/><p>even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike</p><br/><p>deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is</p><br/><p>over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our minds</p><br/><p>for a few hours to something more cheerful.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>       *       *       *       *       *</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all</p><br/><p>was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly</p><br/><p>away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single</p><br/><p>bright light shone out right in front of us.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes</p><br/><p>from the middle window.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining</p><br/><p>that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was</p><br/><p>possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were</p><br/><p>out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow</p><br/><p>light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our</p><br/><p>sombre errand.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired</p><br/><p>breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees,</p><br/><p>we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the</p><br/><p>window, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed</p><br/><p>to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass</p><br/><p>with writhing limbs, and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the</p><br/><p>darkness.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice</p><br/><p>upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh, and put</p><br/><p>his lips to my ear.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was</p><br/><p>a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any</p><br/><p>moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following</p><br/><p>Holmes’s example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the</p><br/><p>bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp</p><br/><p>onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had</p><br/><p>seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of</p><br/><p>his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that</p><br/><p>I could do to distinguish the words:</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I nodded to show that I had heard.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I nodded again.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol</p><br/><p>ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and</p><br/><p>you in that chair.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed</p><br/><p>beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.</p><br/><p>Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,</p><br/><p>not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion</p><br/><p>sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous</p><br/><p>tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray</p><br/><p>of light, and we waited in absolute darkness. From outside came the</p><br/><p>occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long</p><br/><p>drawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at</p><br/><p>liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,</p><br/><p>which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those</p><br/><p>quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat</p><br/><p>waiting silently for whatever might befall.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction</p><br/><p>of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by</p><br/><p>a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Some one in the next</p><br/><p>room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and</p><br/><p>then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half</p><br/><p>an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became</p><br/><p>audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of</p><br/><p>steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,</p><br/><p>Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with</p><br/><p>his cane at the bell-pull.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard</p><br/><p>a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes</p><br/><p>made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed</p><br/><p>so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and</p><br/><p>filled with horror and loathing.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>He had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when</p><br/><p>suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible</p><br/><p>cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a</p><br/><p>hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful</p><br/><p>shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant</p><br/><p>parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold</p><br/><p>to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the</p><br/><p>last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“What can it mean?” I gasped.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after</p><br/><p>all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.</p><br/><p>Roylott’s room.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.</p><br/><p>Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.</p><br/><p>Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked</p><br/><p>pistol in my hand.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a</p><br/><p>dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam</p><br/><p>of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this</p><br/><p>table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, clad in a long</p><br/><p>gray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet</p><br/><p>thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short</p><br/><p>stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin</p><br/><p>was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare</p><br/><p>at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow</p><br/><p>band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round</p><br/><p>his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>I took a step forward. In an instant his strange head-gear began</p><br/><p>to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat</p><br/><p>diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He</p><br/><p>has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,</p><br/><p>recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he</p><br/><p>digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and</p><br/><p>we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter, and let the</p><br/><p>county police know what has happened.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and</p><br/><p>throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck, he drew it from its horrid</p><br/><p>perch, and carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,</p><br/><p>which he closed upon it.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>       *       *       *       *       *</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke</p><br/><p>Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has</p><br/><p>already run to too great a length, by telling how we broke the sad news</p><br/><p>to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the</p><br/><p>care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official</p><br/><p>inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while</p><br/><p>indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet</p><br/><p>to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled</p><br/><p>back next day.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which</p><br/><p>shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from</p><br/><p>insufficient data. The presence of the gypsies, and the use of the</p><br/><p>word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the</p><br/><p>appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of</p><br/><p>her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I</p><br/><p>can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position</p><br/><p>when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened</p><br/><p>an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the</p><br/><p>door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to</p><br/><p>you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the</p><br/><p>bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped</p><br/><p>to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was</p><br/><p>there as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming</p><br/><p>to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when</p><br/><p>I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a</p><br/><p>supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right</p><br/><p>track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be</p><br/><p>discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a</p><br/><p>clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity</p><br/><p>with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point</p><br/><p>of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who</p><br/><p>could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where</p><br/><p>the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of</p><br/><p>course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to</p><br/><p>the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which</p><br/><p>we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this</p><br/><p>ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it</p><br/><p>would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not</p><br/><p>bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but</p><br/><p>sooner or later she must fall a victim.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.</p><br/><p>An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of</p><br/><p>standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he</p><br/><p>should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,</p><br/><p>and the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts</p><br/><p>which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was</p><br/><p>obviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his</p><br/><p>safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know</p><br/><p>the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I</p><br/><p>heard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did also, and I</p><br/><p>instantly lit the light and attacked it.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the</p><br/><p>other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its</p><br/><p>snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this</p><br/><p>way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s</p><br/><p>death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my</p><br/><p>conscience.”</p><br/>
